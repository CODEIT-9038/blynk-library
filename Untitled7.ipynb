She\\'s dying.\"\\n\\n\"Dying! is it possible? And the poor creature seemed so much better\\nthis morning.\"\\n\\n\"Listen--there!\"\\n\\nA quavering, pitiful wail came to their ears, proceeding from a small\\nwhite tent, half-hidden beneath the low-hanging boughs of the grove.\\nThat cry told the two men, plainer than spoken words, the sad truth.\\nIt told of a household broken and dismembered; of a bereaved husband\\nand daughter, of a dearly-beloved wife and mother who had journeyed\\nthus far from the home of her childhood, only to find a lone grave upon\\nthe prairie, or beside the rock-bound rivulet that wound its noisy way\\nadown the valley.\\n\\nThe two young men stood in silence, gazing toward the tent of mourning.\\nThey did not speak, though not a little agitated. And yet one of the\\ntwo caught himself secretly exulting in the thought that now the\\ngreatest difficulty was removed from the path he had laid out to follow.\\n\\nThe little valley was studded here and there with diminutive tents,\\nwhile white-tilted wagons stood grouped together in an oblong circle.\\nThese alone would have proclaimed the truth: a company of emigrants\\ntenanted the valley.\\n\\nSuch sights were far from being uncommon in that year--1850. A year\\nbefore, the Californian \"gold-fever\" broke out. The first rush was made\\nby men--young and old. But then the fever spread. It infected all--the\\nresult was but natural. Family followed family. Almost from ocean to\\nocean an unbroken train of emigrants toiled wearily on--on toward\\nthe glittering phantom that but too often vanished in thin air when\\nseemingly just within their grasp, leaving naught behind but wrecked\\nhopes and ruined fortunes.\\n\\nOne link of the mighty human chain lies before our eyes. For nearly a\\nweek this valley has sheltered them. While others pressed on in the\\nroad for the yellow delusion, this party had been lying motionless,\\nlonging for yet dreading the summons to resume their pilgrimage.\\n\\nA few hasty words will explain.\\n\\nThis party of emigrants, numbering nearly one hundred souls, was under\\nthe command of Caleb Mitchell. He started from Eastern Ohio, in company\\nwith several of his neighbors, heading for the Land of Gold, taking\\nwith him his wife and daughter. Little by little the company grew to\\nmore respectable proportions, as stragglers joined it on the way,\\nuntil now, as they entered the Foothills, they felt little fear of the\\nred-skinned Ishmaelites of whom they had heard so many frightful tales.\\n\\nNearly a week before our story opens, a sad accident occurred. A rifle,\\nsuspended by leather strings in Mitchell\\'s wagon, by some means got\\ndischarged, its contents lodging in Mrs. Mitchell\\'s breast.\\n\\nSince then she had been hovering between life and death. To continue\\ntheir journey would be her certain death, and the kind-hearted\\nemigrants would not abandon their leader in his distress, though each\\nday of delay increased their danger of being overtaken by winter in the\\nmountains. Thus for nearly a week they waited and watched. Slowly Mrs.\\nMitchell sunk, and now, on this day, her spirit took its departure. The\\ndaughter, Lottie, was the first to notice the presence of death, and it\\nwas her heart-broken wail that saluted the ears of the two young men,\\nBurr Wythe and Paley Duplin.\\n\\n\"It is all over!\" muttered Duplin, drawing a long breath.\\n\\n\"Poor girl--\\'twill just about kill her; she worshipped her mother,\"\\nadded Burr, his blue eyes winking rapidly.\\n\\n\"It _is_ sad--but then, since it must be so, it\\'s well that all is\\nover. A long road lies before us, and the mountains must be crossed\\nbefore the snow falls. The lives of all depend upon it.\"\\n\\n\"Mitchell knows that. _He_ will not delay us any longer than is\\nabsolutely necessary. But come--there is work to do. We can help them.\"\\n\\n\"Wait, Burr. I must see you to-night, alone. I have something of great\\nimportance to tell you. Meantime, look at this--but, remember, don\\'t\\nbreathe a word of your suspicions. Keep it hid--at least until I say\\nyou may speak.\"\\n\\nThe young man, Duplin, seemed strongly excited for one of his usual\\nphlegm. As he spoke, he thrust a small article into Wythe\\'s hand, and\\nrenewing his caution, glided hastily away.\\n\\nWonderingly Burr bent over the stone--for such it seemed. But then\\na wild glow filled his eyes, lighting up his entire countenance,\\nwhile his muscular form quivered like one under the influence of an\\nague-shock.\\n\\n\"Is it--can it be _gold_?\" he gasped, huskily.\\n\\nHe too was a victim of the \"yellow fever.\" It had lured him from\\nhis far-away home amidst the northern pines of Maine. It had proved\\nstronger than the pleadings of his aged father and mother, stronger\\nthan the love of his sister and younger brother. He had left them all\\nto chase up this glittering phantom; and now, for the first time, his\\neyes rested upon the substance of his dreams by day and by night.\\n\\nLittle wonder, then, that his heart beat fast and hard, that his brain\\nthrobbed hotly and his eyes gleamed with a wild light--with the long\\nsmoldering fires of greed that might waken to avarice.\\n\\nThe little pebble lay in his palm, looking innocent enough. Its dull\\nsurface was scratched and cut here and there, as if by a knife-point.\\nIf gold, the nugget must be very pure.\\n\\n\"Hellow, old boy, what ye thinkin\\' so soberly \\'bout, eh?\" suddenly\\nuttered a not disagreeable voice, as a heavy hand was placed upon\\nBurr\\'s shoulder, and a heavily-bearded face met his startled gaze.\\n\\nWythe started, and the nugget fell from his hand. Hastily he snatched\\nit up, and thrust it into his pocket, but not before the keen black\\neyes of the new-comer had fallen upon it. In his agitation Burr did not\\nnotice the quick, suspicious flash that lighted up the man\\'s face, else\\nhe might have used more caution.\\n\\n\"What is it to _you_, Nate Upshur?\" and Wythe shook the hand from his\\nshoulder, with a gesture of dislike. \"My thoughts are my own, and none\\nthe more agreeable for you thrusting yourself in upon them.\"\\n\\n\"You speak sharp words, youngster, but best weigh them better. You\\'re\\nnot in the States, now, where a man\\'s afeard to take up a cross word\\nfor fear o\\' the courts. Take a fool\\'s advice, an\\' give a civil answer\\nto a civil question, or you _may_ chaince to run foul o\\' a snag, one o\\'\\nthese long-come-shortlys.\"\\n\\n\"And I hold myself ready to accommodate _you_, whenever you feel\\ninclined to try it on, Nate Upshur. I hope that is plain enough for\\nyour comprehension,\" contemptuously added Burr, turning away.\\n\\nUpshur bit his lip fiercely, and fingered the brass-bound butt of the\\nrevolver at his waist, but made no attempt to draw it.\\n\\n\"Fer little I\\'d--but never mind, now. But I _would_ like to know whar\\nhe got that--if it _was_ gold.\"\\n\\nAs the broad red disk of the full moon rose above the eastern swell\\nthat night, it shone down upon a peculiarly weird and impressive scene\\nin the little timber-grove beside the creek. It was a burial in the\\nwilderness.\\n\\nBeneath a wide-spreading cottonwood tree the grave had been dug. And\\nnow, gathered round the spot, with bowed and uncovered heads, stood or\\nknelt every member of the wagon-train, listening to the broken, sobbing\\nwords of the bereaved husband, Mr. Mitchell. His daughter, Lottie, was\\nbeside him, pale and care-worn, bearing up against the blow with a\\nfictitious strength that threatened to give way at any moment.\\n\\nThere was scarcely a dry eye among all these, as the strong man\\nbroke down, and bowing his head, mingled his tears with those of his\\ndaughter. It was a moment of heart-crushing agony.\\n\\nLottie, who was completely exhausted, swooned, and was borne to the\\nnearest tent by sympathizing friends. Mr. Mitchell, nerving himself to\\nthe task, completed the service, then stood by in silence while the\\ndead was being hidden forever from mortal view. Then, in a low but\\nsteady voice, he spoke:\\n\\n\"I thank you, friends, for your kindness. I will not soon forget it.\\nBut now go and try to sleep. We can afford to lose no more time.\\nTo-morrow day-dawn must see us once more upon the road. Go--leave me\\nalone here for a minute.\"\\n\\n\"Come with me, Wythe, and you too, Tyrrel,\" muttered Paley Duplin.\\n\"There\\'s something I\\'d like to talk over with you to-night.\"\\n\\n\"Is it about that piece--\"\\n\\n\"Yes--but hist!\" and Duplin glanced apprehensively around him. \"We\\nthree are enough. I don\\'t care for more in the secret--much less _that_\\nman,\" and he nodded to where Nate Upshur stood leaning against a\\ntree-trunk, close at hand.\\n\\n\"Come, then; the knoll out yonder is the best place. No one could get\\nwithin ear-shot of us, even should they try, without being seen.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s up, boys?\" muttered Jack Tyrrel, a young rattle-brained Ohioan.\\n\\n\"Wait--you\\'ll know soon enough.\"\\n\\nGaining the knoll spoken of, the three friends crouched down amid the\\ntall, rank grass and lighted their pipes. Duplin was the first to break\\nthe silence.\\n\\n\"You looked at what I showed you, Burr?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; it\\'s _gold_. Where did you get it, Paley?\"\\n\\n\"Gold--le\\'s see,\" eagerly interrupted Tyrrel.\\n\\n\"Wait--the moon does not shine clear enough to show it now. Now, then,\\nI want you to pay particular attention to what I say. Weigh it well in\\nyour minds, for on this night the whole course of our future lives may\\ndepend. That is, on how you decide. You understand?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--that is, I would if I _did_; but I _don\\'t_,\" muttered Jack,\\nlugubriously. \"Well, go on, anyhow.\"\\n\\n\"You know what we are going to California after?\"\\n\\n\"Sure! After gold; the shining dust--the great blazing nuggets, big as\\na water-bucket. Those are what we\\'re after of course.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'d know it when you found one, I suppose, Jack?\" and Duplin smiled\\nslightly.\\n\\n\"Bah! _any_ fool knows gold.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I do. But, as I was about to say, I don\\'t think there is any\\nneed of our going clear to California for what we can get closer.\"\\n\\n\"What--Duplin, what do you mean?\" demanded Wythe, gazing keenly into\\nhis comrade\\'s face.\\n\\n\"No, Burr; I\\'m an honest man, if not a good one. You need not fear any\\nthing of _that_ sort. But I\\'ll tell you all now, on one condition.\\nPromise me faithfully that neither one of you will ever breathe a word\\nof my secret until after one year has passed. This, I mean, provided\\nyou refuse to accept my proposal, for if you _do_ accept it, I know\\nyou\\'ll keep silent. How is it--do you agree?\"\\n\\n\"I reckon we can, Burr?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; though I have not known you long, Duplin, I believe that you\\nare an honest man. Then I promise you, on my honor as a man, that I\\nwill never, by word, sign nor hint, reveal what you confide to me as a\\nsecret.\"\\n\\n\"And I say the same; will swear to it, if you prefer,\" added Tyrrel.\\n\\n\"No. I can trust you without that. Well, then, listen--hist! I thought\\nI heard a footstep,\" muttered Duplin, warningly.\\n\\n\"I guess it comes from the camp,\" suggested Burr, rising erect and\\ngazing keenly around. \"I can see nothing nearer than there.\"\\n\\n\"It may be; I suppose I am nervous. I wouldn\\'t like for any one to\\noverhear what I\\'m about to say, for though enough for us three, it\\nwould go but a little way divided among the train.\"\\n\\n\"_It?_\"\\n\\n\"By that I mean what I have found--what I stumbled on this afternoon\\nas I was coming back to camp. Boys--_I\\'ve found a placer_!\"\\n\\n\"Eh--what?\" stammered the two young men, completely amazed, though\\ntheir thoughts had already reverted to some such revelation.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis true--I\\'ve found a gold placer--a pocket--a regular _bed of\\ngold_!\" panted Duplin, his eyes fairly blazing.\\n\\nWythe gazed keenly into Duplin\\'s face, as though trying to decide\\nwhether or no he had gone crazy. Jack Tyrrel divided his glances\\nbetween them, the while dolefully scratching his curly pate.\\n\\n\"Yes, think of that! A regular bed of gold, full of nuggets that are so\\npure you can mark them with a pin-point, almost. I could have filled my\\npockets in an hour.\"\\n\\n\"Where is it--where is it? Let\\'s go there now, before some one else\\nsteals it away! Come on; thunder and lightning, man, why don\\'t you\\n_come_?\" muttered Tyrrel, half-angrily.\\n\\n\"Easy, Jack,\" and Duplin calmed his exultation by a desperate effort.\\n\"Do you want the whole train after us? No, no; we must work more\\ncunningly than that. I\\'ve planned it all; listen, and I\\'ll tell you\\nwhat we must do.\"\\n\\n\"Wait, Paley,\" quietly interrupted Burr. \"Begin at the beginning and\\ntell it all. First, how came you to find this pocket?\"\\n\\n\"You know I went out hunting, early this morning. Well, I had no luck,\\nand it was past noon before I got a shot. Then I dropped a \\'bighorn,\\'\\nafter an hour\\'s work sneaking over the rocks. It fell down a precipice,\\nand pretty soon I found a pass by which I could follow after. It was\\nhard work, though, and I no sooner reached the valley, or basin,\\nrather, than I began hunting for water.\\n\\n\"Half a mile distant, I saw what looked like the bed of a creek, and\\nset off toward it. Such it proved, in fact, though the water was\\nmissing. I set off up its bed, hoping to find a water-hole or something\\nof the kind. Nearly a mile further up, the bed began to spread and grow\\nmore shallow. Then I knew that if I found water, it must be by digging\\nfor it.\\n\\n\"I did dig, in a dozen places, but all was dry. At one spot, I kept\\ndigging until I made a hole nearly shoulder deep, as the sand felt cool\\nand damp. My knife struck on what seemed to be a pebble, and I pulled\\nit out with one hand and flung it aside. As I did so, the sunlight\\nglittered from its side, where my knife had struck. I looked--it was\\nthe lump you have, Wythe--and saw that _it was gold_!\" and pausing,\\nDuplin hurriedly brushed the sweat from his brow, though the night air\\nwas cool and bracing.\\n\\n\"Great Lord! go on--hurry up!\" muttered Tyrrel, excitedly.\\n\\n\"One glance told me what it was. It was what I had journeyed over\\nfifteen hundred miles in search of, and there it lay, in my hand. I\\ntell you, boys, it nearly _killed me_--and I haven\\'t got over it yet.\\nI half believe now that I am asleep and only dreaming all this; I do,\\nhonestly.\\n\\n\"I did then, too. I sat there for a full hour, almost afraid to move,\\nlooking first at the hole, then at the nugget. I told myself over and\\nover again, that I was a fool--that this was only a stray lump that\\nhad been dropped here by some Indians, years ago. And yet, even as I\\nsaid so, the top sand seemed to melt away showing to me great masses of\\ngold, pure and yellow, looking like petrified sunshine. Actually, for a\\ntime I believe that I was _mad--gold crazy_.\"\\n\\n\"Look here, Paley Duplin,\" muttered Jack Tyrrel, suspiciously, as the\\nyoung man paused in his speech. \"Better mind what you\\'re about. If this\\nis a joke--if you are making this all up just to have a laugh at us,\\nI\\'ll lick you clean out o\\' your boots! If I don\\'t, then it\\'s no matter!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s no joke, Jack, my dear fellow, but sober earnest. Sometimes,\\nthough, I feel tempted to wish it _was_ a joke.\"\\n\\n\"Duplin!\"\\n\\n\"A fact. I don\\'t know _why_, but there seems to be a cloud over me--I\\nfeel as though some great calamity was impending. Boys, you may laugh\\nat me, but while I was thus stupefied, I saw my mother\\'s spirit before\\nme, beckoning me to leave the spot. She--it was crying, I thought, as\\nthough I was in peril. I saw it as plain as I see you now. I flung\\ndown the nugget and fled. Not far, though. Then I stopped. The bright,\\nyellow devils seemed to beckon me back. I took a step forward, and\\n_she_ vanished. Then I went back to the hole,\" and as he spoke, Duplin\\ntrembled violently.\\n\\n\"And you found it then--the hole, I mean? It hadn\\'t vanished?\"\\nwhispered Jack, breathlessly.\\n\\n\"No,\" smiling faintly. \"It was still there. I dug then, like a madman.\\nI tore up the ground for a dozen feet around. Look--my fingers are worn\\nto the quick. I found more nuggets--I found a dozen more, all larger\\nthan that, lying close together. I don\\'t know how large the pocket may\\nbe, but I saw enough to feel sure that there is a great fortune there\\nfor each one of us; enough, at any rate, to make us independent for\\nlife.\"\\n\\n\"You thought of us, then, as sharers in the pocket with you?\" queried\\nBurr Wythe.\\n\\n\"No, not then. I only thought of myself, and of how I could secure the\\ntreasure without being suspected and robbed--for I believe that, in my\\nmadness then, I would have denied my own father a nugget from all that\\nstore. It was horrible--that sensation. I can realize now what a miser\\nfeels. God protect me from another such attack!\" shuddered Duplin.\\n\\n\"But your plan--what do you intend doing?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve weighed the matter well, and this is what I\\'ve decided upon.\\nWe three are enough. I selected you two, because I knew that I could\\ndepend upon you. Our first move will be to desert the wagon-train.\"\\n\\n\"Desert?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. What is there to hinder us? Nothing. We are passengers, and our\\nfare is already paid. We owe them nothing. They will be the gainers as\\nwell as we.\"\\n\\n\"How can we get our tools without exciting suspicion, though?\"\\n\\n\"We don\\'t need them. One pick-ax will be enough. We can shape wooden\\nshovels with our knives. This, our blankets and weapons are all we\\nneed. Remember that what mining we do, will only be in the soft sand.\\nThe gold is in nuggets, not dust or scales, so there will be little or\\nno washing to be done. As for food, a day\\'s hunt will furnish enough to\\nlast us a week, with care in curing it. You see I\\'ve neglected nothing.\\nTrue, we may encounter dangers and suffer privations, but no more here\\nthan there where we first started for.\\n\\n\"Two, or perhaps three weeks\\' work, then we can start for _home_. Two\\nmonths, at the furthest--then we will be made men for life. Now you\\nknow all. What is your decision?\"\\n\\n\"You say we must desert?\" mused Wythe, thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"Yes. What excuse could we give? We must slip off to-night, without a\\nword to _anybody_. I know what you are thinking of, Wythe. Nay, don\\'t\\nflush up so. \\'Tis nothing to be ashamed of. She\\'s a noble, true-hearted\\ngirl, and one that would be a rich prize for any man. I might have\\nloved her myself, only that I had a talisman. In Ohio there is one\\nwaiting for me, who, please God, will one day be my wife,\" and Duplin,\\nas he spoke, reverently uncovered his head.\\n\\n\"You are right, friend, and I\\'m not offended. But--I would like to\\nspeak a word to her before we go, just to keep her from thinking hard\\nof us.\"\\n\\n\"You could not, Burr, without giving a broad clue to our purpose. She\\nwould not be able to see you to-night, anyhow, after her poor mother\\'s\\ndeath. You must have patience. Think how short the time will be, if you\\ndo not fling this chance from you, before you can go to her with a free\\nheart and full hand.\"\\n\\n\"He talks good sense, Burr. Some other time will do to say good-by in.\"\\n\\n\"Well, maybe it is for the best. I\\'d only make a fool of myself. Then,\\nhere\\'s my hand. I\\'m with you, Duplin, for better or worse.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m number three!\" chimed in Tyrrel.\\n\\n\"Good! Now there only remains to collect our things. I\\'ll see to the\\npick. I left mine out, to-day, after _that_. See to your arms and\\nammunition, and get a store of coffee. It\\'s paid for, remember. Fill\\nyour pockets with cold grub, for they _may_ make a search for us,\\nthough I hardly think it. Time\\'s too precious for that. Go, now, and\\nkeep close guard over your tongues. \\'Twould take but a trifle to direct\\nsuspicion when we are found gone, and then good-by to our fortune.\"\\n\\n\"Trust us--we\\'ll be wise as the dove, and so forth,\" muttered Tyrrel.\\n\\nThe three plotters glided away and soon rejoined the camp. Scarcely had\\nthey disappeared from view, when a dark figure cautiously raised itself\\nabove the level of the prairie-grass, where it had been concealed in a\\nhollow, and peered curiously after them, a low, disagreeable chuckle\\nbreaking from the black-bearded lips.\\n\\n\"Ho! ho! ho! Nate Upshur, you\\'re in luck, my boy! Fust you see the\\nnugget Wythe drops, then you hear Duplin whisper to him an\\' Tyrrel,\\nand now, best of all, you hear the whole story! Thar\\'s luck in odd\\nnumbers--and yet I\\'m goin\\' to have a finger in the pie, too.\"\\n\\nThen he, too, proceeded stealthily toward the camp, by a circuitous\\nroute, entering unobserved.\\n\\nThat night, the sick-camp was the scene of strange acts. And among them\\nwas one of terror--of cold-blooded, merciless crime.\\n\\nAs the bright moon sailed from behind a dense cloud, a dark figure\\nsilently crept into the shadow cast by a small white tent. From within,\\nas the shadow paused, came the sound of calm, steady breathing. Then\\nthe door-flap was raised--the black shadow cautiously glided into the\\ntent, like a venomous serpent in human form. The flap falls behind the\\nserpent, and all is still.\\n\\nThen--a horrible sound breaks the stillness of the night--a faint,\\ngasping, half-stifled groan of death-agony. Then the shadow reappears,\\nbearing in one hand a blood-stained knife, in the other a small parcel\\nthat chinks metallic-like as it falls from its hand. Then all is still.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER II.\\n\\n                          THE TELL-TALE PIPE.\\n\\n\\nLong before the first beams of breaking day illumined the eastern\\nhorizon, the shrill voice of the little, wrinkled, half-apish-looking\\nguide, Paul Chicot, roused the sleeping camp, bidding all prepare for\\na long, hard day\\'s travel. Eagerly the emigrants flew around, for once\\nmore the golden phantom seemed beckoning them on.\\n\\nAnd yet, despite their anxiety, that day was to carry them no nearer\\nthe golden land. A blow fell that for the moment drove away all such\\nthoughts.\\n\\n\"Whar\\'s Dutchy?\" suddenly queried Paul Chicot, running his beadlike\\neyes rapidly around the little group.\\n\\nAs customary, the emigrants were regularly divided into \"messes.\"\\nOne of these messes was formed by the guide, Chicot, Nate Upshur, an\\nIrishman called Tim Dooley, and \"Dutchy,\" as the fourth member was\\nfamiliarly known.\\n\\nThis last personage was an enigma to the greater portion of the\\nemigrants. At times he appeared the polished scholar, then again one\\nof the most ignorant men imaginable. He had joined the train at St.\\nCharles, preferring the overland route on account of his poor health,\\nhoping thus to recuperate. He seemed possessed of plenty of money,\\npaying his fare in gold, without a demur at the price.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know--I hain\\'t seen him since last night,\" replied Upshur,\\nwiping his lips, after a long draught of coffee.\\n\\n\"Go hyste him out, Tim. He takes so durned long to fix up his ha\\'r an\\'\\nteeth afore eatin\\' thet he won\\'t be ready fer the road none too soon.\\nTell \\'im we\\'re all ready fer startin\\',\" muttered Chicot.\\n\\nDooley arose and glided toward a small tent a little to one side,\\nand pushing back the hanging door-flap, entered. The next moment he\\nreappeared, staggering back with starting eyeballs and hair standing\\non end, a wild cry bursting from his pallid lips.\\n\\nThe shrill cry startled the entire camp, and all eyes were turned\\ntoward the trembling man. Paul Chicot was the first to speak, in an\\nangry tone:\\n\\n\"What the devil\\'s the matter wi\\' ye _now_, I\\'d like to ax? See\\'d\\nanother snake, eh?\" he asked, sarcastically.\\n\\n\"It\\'s murther, that\\'s what it is! He\\'s kilt--kilt intirely!\" gasped\\nDooley, his eyes still glaring toward the quiet tent, as if enchanted\\nby the horrible object lying so still and ghastly within.\\n\\n\"Who\\'s kilt--not Dutchy?\" quietly demanded Upshur, stepping forward.\\n\\nChicot, giving over all idea of getting any thing satisfactory out of\\nthe stupefied Irishman, sprung forward and flung aside the strip of\\ncanvas that protected the entrance. One glance told him the truth. Tim\\nwas right. Murder had been done!\\n\\nLying upon a couple of blankets, was all that remained of their quaint,\\npleasant comrade, Carl Hefler, or \"Dutchy,\" the _sobriquet_ suggested\\nby his broken, stammering speech.\\n\\nThe long, slim figure lay at full length, as though peacefully\\nslumbering, but the arms were flung wide, the long, bony fingers\\nclutched as though in agony. An agonized expression had frozen upon the\\nthin, pallid face.\\n\\nOn the white shirt-bosom was a great stain--a stain of that peculiar,\\nunmistakable color that seldom requires a second glance to designate.\\nDirectly above the heart the stain was blackest. There the blow had\\nbeen dealt.\\n\\nChicot, old and thoroughly versed in that art peculiar to his craft\\nand the detectives--of remarking _everything_--knew that no feeble,\\nfaltering hand had dealt this blow. Either the hand of an unusually\\nbold and cool-headed man, or else that of one to whom such deeds had\\nbeen familiar.\\n\\nHe knew that the murderer had crept fairly into the tent, had glided\\nclose to the victim, as he lay buried in unconscious slumber, and that\\nhe must have even felt out the region of the heart, since all within\\nhad been dark, else the blow could never have been delivered with such\\ndeadly precision.\\n\\n\"What is all this, Chicot?\" hurriedly demanded the leader, Mitchell, as\\nhe reached the guide\\'s side.\\n\\n\"It\\'s _murder_--thet\\'s what it is,\" coolly returned Chicot.\\n\\n\"But who could--\"\\n\\n\"Thet\\'s jest what I\\'m goin\\' to find out, \\'f you give me time. Keep\\nback--don\\'t none o\\' you step inside here ontil I say ye may. Mebbe\\nthar\\'s some sign left.\"\\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t it be a good plan to call the roll and see if all are\\npresent?\" suddenly suggested Upshur, his eyes gleaming furtively.\\n\\n\"\\'Twon\\'t do no harm. You mought as well, cap\\'n,\" muttered Chicot. \"This\\n\\'ll keep us back hafe the day, anyhow, ef not more.\"\\n\\nMitchell promptly sounded his whistle--and taught its meaning, the\\nmembers of the wagon-train followed his lead back to the open ground.\\nUpshur ran his eyes hastily over the group. Then the evil glow\\ndeepened, and his lip curled with triumph.\\n\\nChicot, free from the annoying crowd, proceeded with his\\ninvestigations, with all the relish of a true-born detective. Yet there\\nseemed little show of his making any discovery, since the floor of the\\nlittle tent was beaten hard and dry by the murdered man\\'s own feet,\\nduring the stay at the sick-camp.\\n\\nOf course no _trail_ had been left, nor did he seek for one. His eye\\nhad already fallen upon the little leather sachel, lying beside the\\ndead man\\'s head, where it had been dragged from beneath the blankets.\\nIts lock was unbroken, but one side had been slit through with a\\nknife--the same weapon that had dealt the death-blow, for the leather\\nwas stained here and there with blood.\\n\\n\"He stuck \\'im fer the money,\" muttered Paul, as he dropped the valise.\\n\\nSuddenly he stooped and lifted the right arm of the dead man. A tiny\\npoint of something yellow had caught his keen eye.\\n\\nChicot uttered a low grunt, and started back. The clue was before him;\\nand yet he scarce believed his eyes. Could it be?--\\n\\nExposed to view lay a small, curiously-carved meerschaum pipe, with\\nstem of bright, clear amber. This it was that had caught his eye.\\n\\nChicot turned and left the tent, slowly gliding out toward where\\nMitchell was calling over the list. The guide\\'s brows contracted as he\\nlistened.\\n\\n\"John Tyrrel.\"\\n\\n\"Not here,\" slowly replied a voice, after a brief, painful silence.\\n\\n\"Burr Wythe.\"\\n\\n\"I reckon he\\'s gone, too, cap\\'n,\" quietly uttered Chicot. \"Thar ain\\'t\\nmuch use o\\' your goin\\' any furder. I think I\\'ve found the right eend o\\'\\nthe trail.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean, Paul?\" cried Mitchell, in surprise. \"Surely you\\ndon\\'t suspect--\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t go by \\'spicions, myself, but I know a trail when I strike it.\\nCome an\\' look fer yourself--one at a time, though. See what I\\'ve found,\\nthen say who it b\\'longs to.\"\\n\\nOne by one the party filed into the tent and glanced at the tell-tale\\npipe. All recognized it. There was not another in any wise resembling\\nit in the company.\\n\\n\"Whose pipe is it, boys?\" demanded Chicot.\\n\\n\"Burr Wythe\\'s!\" came the reply, the voice of Nat Upshur above all\\nothers.\\n\\n\"But _he_ may not have dropped it there,\" suggested Mitchell. \"Might\\nnot Hefler have borrowed it?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" declared Upshur, stepping forward. \"Hefler went to bed just after\\ndark, and I saw Wythe smoking that pipe as late as two o\\'clock, and he\\nwas talking with Jack Tyrrel and Paley Duplin, at the time.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s so--I see\\'d \\'em, too,\" reluctantly added Chicot.\\n\\n\"I admit that it has an awkward look, but after all, though those three\\nare absent, they may return soon and clear matters up. If he, or they,\\nare guilty, I will not be one of those who would seek to screen them\\nfrom justice; but for all that, they shall not be condemned without\\na chance to clear themselves. First we must find them,\" said the\\nwagon-master.\\n\\n\"But it is nearly sunrise; we were to take up the march to-day,\"\\nventured one.\\n\\n\"Justice first: we must not let this brutal murder go unavenged. One\\nday, more or less, can make but little difference to us, in the end. If\\nWythe did kill him, he must pay the penalty.\"\\n\\n\"But what object could he have in doing it? They were good friends, so\\nfar as I know.\"\\n\\n\"Look here,\" uttered Chicot, lifting the cut sachel. \"This is what the\\nDutchman kept his money in. He was a simple-hearted feller, like, an\\'\\ndidn\\'t seem to think but that all was as honest as he was hisself,\\nfer he showed us his money only two nights ago. We laughed at him, I\\n\\'member, fer kerryin\\' gold to Californey, but he wasn\\'t goin\\' to dig.\\nHe went overland fer his health, and then was goin\\' to ship fer Chinese\\nland, or some sech place, I b\\'lieve.\"\\n\\n\"Who was with you when he showed the money?\"\\n\\n\"_He_ was--Burr Wythe--an\\' a lot more,\" reluctantly added Chicot.\\n\\nMitchell looked sober. He had formed a high opinion of the young man,\\nbut he could no longer blind himself to the fact that suspicion pointed\\nstrongly toward young Wythe as the murderer. And he saw, too, that\\nthis belief was gradually gaining ground among the emigrants, and deep\\nwhispers ran round, while eyes flashed and brows grew black. The spirit\\nof Lynch-law was rapidly arising, and woe be unto the victim that\\nshould first feel its power!\\n\\n\"Easy, men,\" he shouted, waving his hand. \"Keep silent for a moment\\nand listen to me. There must be no mad action here. We must proceed\\ncarefully and justly. First, you must elect a leader, whose word shall\\nbe law; then we must hunt up the missing men and hear their defense.\\nThat one murder has been committed is no reason that another should\\nfollow. I cast my vote for a fair trial.\"\\n\\n\"So we all do, I reckon,\" chimed in Paul Chicot. \"An\\' I don\\'t know any\\nbetter man for Judge Lynch than you be. What say, boys?\"\\n\\n\"Good--good!\" came an almost unanimous shout; but Nathan Upshur was\\nsilent.\\n\\n\"Very well; I will act as such, since you demand it. And I am glad,\\nfor one thing. After what I have already spoken, it shows that you\\naim at strict and impartial justice. But now to work. If they have\\nreally abandoned the train--as of course they have, if they _did_ kill\\nHefler--they must have taken food and other articles that would be\\nmissed. And a close search may give us the clue. You know the messes\\nthey belonged to; go and search closely. Chicot, come with me. I wish a\\nword with you.\"\\n\\nOnce fairly set to work, there was little time lost. In ten minutes\\nthe report was given. A small supply of provisions had been taken, and\\none pick-ax was missing; but that all believed to have been mislaid\\nsomewhere. No one--save Upshur--dreamed that the deserters had taken it.\\n\\nPaul Chicot gave his supposition or conjecture concerning the course\\nmost likely to be followed by the deserters. He believed they would\\ntake to the neighboring mountains, there to lie hidden until all search\\nwas given over. They would not be likely to take the back-trail, as\\nthey were afoot, and the country in that direction was mostly open and\\nlevel.\\n\\n\"I believe you\\'re right, Chicot,\" remarked Mitchell, thoughtfully, \"and\\nwe will act on that supposition first. We\\'d best form three or four\\nparties and each choose a separate trail, for this day is all we can\\nspare without absolute danger to the whole train.\"\\n\\nLittle time was lost, now that the duty before them was fairly decided\\nupon, and all entered upon it with growing eagerness. There is\\nsomething strangely exciting in a _manhunt_. Set a warm friend upon the\\ntrack of another, and, when once fairly aroused, that friend will be as\\ninveterate and deadly in pursuit as though a lifelong enemy.\\n\\nThis trait was exemplified now. Before an hour more passed by, even\\nthose who had first declared their belief in the young man\\'s innocence,\\nwere the foremost in searching for his trail, eager to bring him to\\njustice.\\n\\nNathan Upshur kept close to Paul Chicot, the guide, eying him\\nfurtively, seemingly ill at ease. It was plainly evident that he felt\\nno great desire for Burr Wythe\\'s capture. Indeed, he tried to mislead\\nPaul, and finally succeeded in doing so.\\n\\nUpshur had stealthily followed the three deserters for a considerable\\ndistance, on the night before, when they started for the \"golden bed,\"\\nas Duplin had called it, the better to satisfy his mind as to the\\nlocation of the placer. And now for reasons of his own, he craftily\\nled Chicot far astray from the right course, though none of the\\ntrail-hunters suspected his purpose.\\n\\nSatisfied with this, Upshur contentedly followed the guide\\'s lead,\\nfeeling assured there was little or no danger of striking the\\ndeserters\\' trail, on that day at least. But at a cry from Chicot, his\\nheart leaped wildly, and the flush left his face pale and ghastly.\\n\\n\"Hold! Stand back, you fellers,\" cried Chicot, lifting a hand in\\nwarning, as his companions rushed forward, eager to learn the cause of\\nhis sudden exclamation.\\n\\n\"What is it, Chicot?\" gasped Upshur.\\n\\n\"A trail, but not the one we\\'re looking fer,\" was the slow reply, as\\nPaul closely scrutinized the ground.\\n\\nUpshur gave a gasp of relief, unnoticed by those near, and then pressed\\nforward. Pausing beside Chicot, he bent his gaze down upon the narrow\\nstrip of moist sand, upon which was imprinted the strange trail.\\n\\nThere, plainly outlined, was the impress of a large human foot, naked\\nand bare. That it was not made by an Indian was plain, for though many\\nwhite men in-toe, a red-man, unless an habitual drunkard, _never_ toes\\nout, as this trail plainly did. Then, again, an Indian\\'s foot, from\\nnever having been tightly compressed in boots or shoes, is very flat\\nand broad; this trail was made by a man with a high instep and arching\\nsole.\\n\\n\"How do you know it isn\\'t one of them?\" asked Upshur.\\n\\n\"Easily enough. Look back along the trail. You see, it crosses that\\nstretch o\\' splintered rocks? Now, look at these tracks. The foot ain\\'t\\ncut none. That shows that it\\'s made by a feller that\\'s _used_ to goin\\'\\nbar\\'foot fer a long time. Ef _you_ was to cross that, you\\'d cut an\\'\\ngouge your hoofs so this \\'ere \\'d be a trail o\\' blood. See?\"\\n\\n\"But who can it be then?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t know. It\\'s fresh--ain\\'t bin made over a hour, at furderest.\\nWhoever it is, must be in the hills yender. _I_ move we foller on, an\\'\\nfind \\'im. Mebbe he kin tell us somethin\\' \\'bout the boys,\" suggested\\nChicot, moving forward, without waiting to learn the wishes of his\\nfollowers.\\n\\nIn fact, Chicot was only too glad of a good excuse to delay the search\\nfor Burr Wythe. Though firmly believing him guilty of the murder,\\nyet he did not wish to be the instrument of justice. In his quiet,\\nunobtrusive way, he loved Burr, almost as he would have loved a son.\\n\\nThe trail led in a direct line toward the hills, here rising abrupt\\nand rocky, broken and rugged. Though at times losing all trace, Chicot\\nfound little difficulty in recovering the trail as often.\\n\\nAn abrupt exclamation from Nathan Upshur startled him, and all eyes\\nturned upon him. His face wore an expression of wonder, as he pointed\\nwith outstretched hand toward the rocks above the party.\\n\\n\"Look there! Is it man, or devil?\"\\n\\nGlancing in the direction indicated, the trail-hunters beheld the\\nobject of his wonder. And they, too, stood as if bewildered. And little\\nwonder. A truly strange object was before their eyes.\\n\\nStanding erect upon a large bowlder, half-way up the hill, was a human\\nform, though strange and wild-looking enough to have been taken for\\nsomething supernatural. One long arm was extended, pointing toward\\nthem, the rags that only partially clothed the member fluttering in the\\nbrisk breeze.\\n\\nThe stranger seemed far above the usual height of men, and of great\\nage, if the long, flowing hair and beard of a snowy whiteness be taken\\nas evidence. This the wind tossed wildly around his face, in a fleecy\\ncloud.\\n\\nRude, uncouth garments partially covered his body and limbs, patched\\nhere and there with pieces of skin and fur. In one hand he bore a heavy\\nbow, tightly strung. At his shoulder could be seen the feathered tips\\nof a number of arrows.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the Mountain Devil!\" muttered Chicot, in a low, hushed tone, as\\nhe shrunk back, his bronzed cheek paling, his eyes dilating with a look\\nof fear.\\n\\n\"Man or devil, I do not fear him!\" said Upshur, as his rifle clicked\\nsharply as the hammer was lifted.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t shoot! Make him mad, an\\' he\\'ll clean out the whole crowd!\"\\nwarningly cried Paul; his eyes still riveted upon the strange form.\\n\"He\\'s a devil--you can\\'t hurt him.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll try it, anyhow,\" and the man\\'s rifle spoke sharp and clear.\\n\\nThe wild-man started and seemed to stagger, as though the bullet had\\nfound its mark. Then, with a shrill cry, he turned and leaped from the\\nbowlder, the next moment disappearing far up the hillside.\\n\\n\"There\\'s your devil, Paul,\" chuckled Upshur, as he dropped his rifle\\nand began reloading it. \"And I had only a leaden bullet in, too.\"\\n\\n\"You laugh now--but the time \\'ll come when you won\\'t. Believe it or\\nnot, Nate Upshur, you\\'ve signed your death papers. A man never shot\\nat the Mountain Devil but he died for it. You will, too. Mebbe not\\nto-day--mebbe not for a year, but the time \\'ll come, I tell you--the\\ntime \\'ll come at last. Mark my words.\"\\n\\n\"Bah! you\\'ve listened too much to Indian legends, Chicot. That is no\\ndevil, but a man, like you or I, turned hermit like. To prove it, I\\'m\\ngoing to follow after. Come on, boys! Let\\'s go and see what Paul\\'s\\ndevil is made of, anyhow,\" recklessly said Upshur, who was no coward,\\nwhatever else he might be.\\n\\nPale and disturbed, Chicot followed the boaster, and close behind came\\nthe other emigrants, curious to see the denouement. At the bowlder\\nUpshur paused, with a harsh laugh.\\n\\n\"See!\" and he pointed at the rocks before him. \"Your devil bleeds,\\nPaul, like an ordinary man. I thought I touched the rascal.\"\\n\\nHere and there drops of blood sprinkled the rocky surface, and Chicot,\\nthough still skeptical, brightened up. After all, this wild-man was not\\nproof against mortal weapons.\\n\\nLaughing scornfully, Upshur led the way along the bloody trail, up the\\nhillside, until it crossed the ridge, keeping a good look-out to guard\\nagainst surprise, for none knew better than he what awkward weapons\\nflint-headed arrows are, at close quarters, when guided by a strong and\\nexperienced hand. And after his wound, the wild-man would not be likely\\nto stand on ceremony, should he be overtaken.\\n\\nBut overtaken he was not, at least on that occasion. The hillside\\nseemed to be unoccupied, save by the trail-hunters, but Upshur\\nsuddenly paused, when half-way down the hill, shrinking back with a cry\\nof horror.\\n\\nPassing through the dense bushes, he had found himself upon the very\\nverge of a steep precipice. Staggering back, he clutched the bushes,\\nunmanned.\\n\\n\"Look yonder!\" cried Chicot, pointing downward. \"_Now_ what do you\\nsay--is he a devil, or not?\"\\n\\nSwiftly racing along the narrow valley far below, was the form of the\\nwild-man. To reach this, he must have descended the precipice, and that\\nseemed beyond mortal skill to accomplish.\\n\\nWonderingly the emigrants watched him until he disappeared upon the\\nfurther hill, then they slowly retraced their steps toward camp. The\\nsun was far down in the west, and they had found no trace of the\\ndeserters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER III.\\n\\n                            THE GOLDEN BED.\\n\\n\\nThe three adventurers, Duplin, Wythe, and Tyrrel, little imagined that\\nat least one pair of keen eyes observed very closely their movements on\\nthat memorable night, as they noiselessly went about their preparations\\nfor their desertion. Jack and Paley were filled with golden visions\\nof the enormous wealth that only awaited their coming to gather it up\\nin handfuls, while Burr thought far more of pretty Lottie Mitchell,\\nand how she would receive the tidings of the strange desertion, for it\\ncould be called by no other name.\\n\\n\"Never mind--if the deposit is as rich as Paley declares, we can finish\\nbefore winter, and then--\"\\n\\nWythe smiled faintly as a far-away look came into his handsome eyes.\\nEven to himself he does not finish the thought, for, though he loved\\nLottie Mitchell with all his young heart, he had scarce spoken a score\\nof times with her, during the journey.\\n\\nStill watched by Nate Upshur, the three adventurers silently left the\\ncamp and set forth upon their mission, all, even the rattle-brained\\nJack Tyrrel, feeling serious, for, truly, it was no commonplace step\\nthey were taking, and one that might well result disastrously. Turning,\\nthey cast a last look at the silent camp of the wagon-train that had\\nfor so many days been their only home, and then, led by Duplin, they\\ndisappeared beyond the ridge, still followed by Nate Upshur, who\\nexhibited the skill and address of a veritable savage.\\n\\nAfter a rapid tramp of several miles, Duplin paused and said:\\n\\n\"Now, boys, for a little headwork. First, shall we go on at once to the\\npocket?\"\\n\\n\"How far is it?\"\\n\\n\"Not ten miles, as the crow flies.\"\\n\\n\"We can reach it before day, then?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--if we wish. But, frankly, I don\\'t think we had better go there,\\nat least not before to-morrow night.\"\\n\\n\"Why so?\"\\n\\n\"Well, there is a risk. To be sure they may not think it worth while to\\nmake any search for us, when our disappearance is found out, yet still\\nthey _may_, especially as the most dangerous portion of the trail is\\nnear at hand. You see three rifles such as ours would count in case of\\nan attack.\"\\n\\n\"If I thought there was the slightest danger of that, I would return at\\nonce,\" suddenly cried Wythe, thinking of Lottie Mitchell.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think there is. You remember the treaty we heard of at the\\nfort? The Indians are all peaceable, now. But, as I was saying, they\\n_may_ try to follow our trail, and if we lay it straight to the pocket,\\nten to one that Paul Chicot picks it out with those keen eyes of his.\\nThen? Instead of a fortune, we\\'d have only a few ounces apiece, and\\nperhaps have to fight for that. You know the material many of the\\nemigrants are composed of. Brave men enough, but rather peculiar in\\ntheir ideas of honesty. It would be \\'divide or fight!\\' and as I found\\nthe pocket, I consider our claim is the best.\"\\n\\n\"You are right there, Paley. But you decide. Whatever you think best,\\nwe will agree to. You agree, Tyrrel?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; Duplin is captain.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, then. We will strike over there toward those hills, and\\nhide there until certain that all fear of pursuit is over. Then to the\\npocket and clean it out, after which--ho! for home!\"\\n\\nWith long, swift strides, Duplin, greatly excited no doubt by the\\npicture his last words had conjured up before his mind\\'s eye, led the\\nway toward the hill alluded to, that rose abruptly, high into the air,\\nrocky, broken and wild-looking.\\n\\nAfter him trudged Burr and Jack, little dreaming of the strange\\nadventure that was to meet them there, in the heart of that wild,\\ndesolate spot.\\n\\nDuplin, who by his superior age and experience, naturally assumed the\\nposition of leader during the adventure, soon selected a spot where the\\ntrio could very comfortably remain concealed during the ensuing day;\\nshould their fear of a pursuit prove correct, and at the same time one\\nnot entirely devoid of comfort.\\n\\nEntering a narrow, level valley, on one side of which uprose an almost\\nperpendicular cliff, its face scarred and jagged, studded here and\\nthere with stunted evergreen shrubs or parasitic plants, they soon\\nfound a secure covert upon the opposite side, where the hill was less\\nabrupt, and more easy of ascent. From here they had a fair view of the\\ncliff, as well as the open ground beyond the mouth of the valley, in\\nthe direction from whence they had come.\\n\\n\"I move that you two lie down for a nap, while I stand guard,\" quoth\\nDuplin, as the trio sunk back upon the soft, mossy earth behind the\\nvine clad rock.\\n\\n\"I want a smoke, first,\" said Tyrrel, producing his pipe.\\n\\n\"And so do I, but can\\'t find my pipe,\" muttered Wythe, vexedly. \"I must\\nhave lost it on the way.\"\\n\\n\"Never mind; that is easily replaced--I mean so far as comfort is\\nconcerned. A bit of bark--a joint of the \\'carpenter\\'s weed,\\' and you\\nhave it.\"\\n\\nThe three comrades conversed, in low, eager tones, of the fortune that\\nlay waiting their coming, and magnificent were the air-castles they\\neach reared, when they should return home, rich men. But one delicious\\none Burr Wythe hugged to his own heart. Only one ear must hear that\\ndream--the ear of sweet Lottie Mitchell.\\n\\n\"Hist!\" muttered Duplin, after an hour or more had crept by.\\n\\nThe two young men caught the same sound, with him, and needed not the\\ncaution to cease their conversation. From close above them, on the\\nhillside, there rattled down several pebbles, evidently dislodged by\\nhuman aid, for directly afterwards the trio could hear a footstep,\\nlight yet deliberate, evidently descending the slope.\\n\\nInstinctively each man grasped his weapon, for the same thought\\noccurred to each. If this footfall betokened the presence of Indians,\\nas seemed but too probable, there was danger threatening. Right well\\nthey knew that no true woodman could pass by, in such close proximity,\\nwithout detecting the scent of tobacco-smoke, and that, once scented,\\nhe would not rest until the matter was thoroughly investigated. And,\\nthough the Indians were nominally at peace, they well knew that if a\\nsuperior force was at hand, that fact would be but a feeble restraint.\\nAt best they must expect to be plundered, and as that meant either\\nstarvation or a return to the wagon-train, the three men prepared\\nsilently for a struggle.\\n\\nThe sound of footsteps ceased, and for several minutes all was silent.\\nMotionless as death, tightly grasping their weapons, the gold-hunters\\nawaited the result in stern suspense.\\n\\nBut their preparations, in this case, were needless, for the footstep\\nagain met their ears, and then, through the surrounding screen of\\nbushes, they observed a tall figure glide past their covert, descending\\nthe hill. Even in that brief glimpse, they saw enough to deeply excite\\ntheir curiosity.\\n\\nPeering through the bushes, they saw that the stranger had again\\npaused, this time standing upon a bowlder, in the full glare of the\\nbright moonlight. They were gazing upon the same being who, a few hours\\nlater, was pronounced the Mountain Devil by Paul Chicot.\\n\\nThey could distinguish his features; pale, haggard and wearing a\\npeculiarly mournful expression, that still did not conceal the vacant\\nstare that proclaimed a shattered mind. This thought occurred to each\\nof the three men. They were watching a madman.\\n\\nThey noted his ragged dress, rudely patched with skins and bits of\\nvarious fur. They saw that he was armed with a bow and arrows, and that\\na long-bladed knife was dangling at his side.\\n\\nThis much they noted before he stepped from the rock and resumed his\\ncourse toward the valley. Arising, the gold-hunters closely observed\\nhis movements, until hidden in the shade cast by the towering precipice\\nbeyond.\\n\\n\"Wonder what--or who the fellow is, anyhow,\" muttered Tyrrel,\\nreflectively.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, unless--You\\'ve heard Paul Chicot speak of a wild-man\\nthey sometimes call the \"Mountain Devil,\" haven\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Who hasn\\'t, I wonder?\" with a shrug. \"I\\'ve heard of nothing else since\\nwe\\'ve been camped here.\"\\n\\n\"I believe this is the being he means, then.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t--thunder! I always thought he was lying!\"\\n\\n\"Hark!\" muttered Burr, touching his comrades.\\n\\nFrom out the gloom, in the direction in which the strange being had\\ndisappeared, there came a clear, shrill whistle, long-drawn and\\nquavering. Eagerly the gold-hunters watched and listened.\\n\\n\"Look there--see that light!\" uttered Duplin, after a brief silence.\\n\"What can it mean--up there, too?\"\\n\\nA small but brilliant point of light had suddenly appeared, as though\\nhanging nearly midway up the cliff, not steady and fixed, but slightly\\nwavering, or moving slowly from side to side. Evidently, it was\\nsuspended there by some human agency; but who?\\n\\n\"Is there not a human form close beside the light? It seems so to me,\"\\nwhispered Wythe.\\n\\n\"Wait. The light is in answer to that whistle. Perhaps Paul\\'s Devil has\\nhis home up there, and that is one of its imps,\" half-laughed Duplin.\\n\\nStill closely watching, the three friends a few moments later saw a\\ntall form uprise beside the light, that, the next instant, vanished\\nfrom sight. But not before another discovery was made.\\n\\nA human being _had_ been holding the light, and as the wild-man took\\nit, the upper portion of the second person had been distinctly,\\nthough momentarily revealed. Duplin was the first to speak, after the\\ndisappearance.\\n\\n\"Did you see that, boys?\"\\n\\n\"I saw something--a shadow, or--\"\\n\\n\"I saw the form of a _woman_!\" declared Burr, in a peculiar tone of\\nvoice.\\n\\n\"So I thought, but was not sure. I don\\'t know what to think of it.\\nThere\\'s some deep mystery here,\" added Paley, reflectively.\\n\\n\"I move we expose it, then,\" impulsively cried Jack. \"Who knows--maybe\\n\\'tis a princess in disguise--or else carried off and kept in seclusion\\nby some evil genie! An adventure--le\\'s go!\"\\n\\n\"Easy, rattlepate,\" laughed Duplin. \"You forget what frightful tales\\nPaul told of this creature, and whether they have any foundation in\\ntruth or not, if we attempt to solve this affair, we must use caution.\\nIf nothing more, he is a madman, and were he to discover our approach,\\nhe might do us mischief. One man then--for they must have a cave, or\\nsomething of the sort--one man then could keep a thousand at bay who\\ntried to reach him by scaling the cliff.\"\\n\\n\"Is it worth the risk?\" thoughtfully uttered Wythe. \"She answered his\\nsignal so promptly, there can be little doubt but she is there by her\\nown free will. Then what right have _we_ to molest them?\"\\n\\n\"The right of unsatisfied curiosity--and whether you go or not, I\\'ll\\nnot rest until I\\'ve had a good peep at the angel--for such she must be\\nif _he\\'s_ a devil,\" cried Tyrrel, springing through the bushes as he\\nspoke.\\n\\n\"Wait, Jack--you\\'ll ruin all by your haste. We\\'ll go--but you must not\\nlead the way. You\\'ll be sure to alarm them.\"\\n\\n\"Very well--all I want is to get a good look at them. Lead the way, if\\nyou\\'d rather.\"\\n\\nDuplin knew the futility of reasoning with Jack, else he would not have\\nbeen drawn into the foolhardy adventure so easily. He knew there was\\ndanger, Tyrrel did not. But alone, Jack would be sure to precipitate\\nthis, and hoping to avoid discovery by due caution, Duplin led the way\\ntoward the cliff, having determined the exact position where the light\\nhad been shown.\\n\\nEvidently the cliff-lodgers had disappeared at the same time the light\\ndid, else they must have discovered the three dark figures as they\\nglided across the open, level valley, plainly outlined by the moon\\'s\\nrays.\\n\\nReaching the foot of the cliff, they began searching for the path by\\nwhich the wild-man must have ascended, but for several minutes without\\nsuccess. Then, however, a low whistle from Burr Wythe called Duplin and\\nTyrrel to his side. Even in that gloom, they could see that the path\\nbore evident traces of having been frequently used, either by bipeds or\\nquadrupeds.\\n\\n\"I think this is folly, boys,\" muttered Duplin.\\n\\n\"Folly or not--up I go,\" determinedly added Jack.\\n\\n\"Then I claim the right to lead the way,\" and so speaking, Paley Duplin\\ncautiously began the difficult ascent, having first carefully deposited\\nhis rifle at the base of the hill; an example that was promptly\\nimitated by his companions.\\n\\nThe trail was comparatively easy of ascent, but the gold-hunters made\\nslow progress, as Duplin carefully examined each foot of the way, lest\\nhe should be misled by the numerous other clefts and seeming paths that\\nthickly crossed the trace. Thus he neared the point from whence he felt\\nsure the light had been shown, and as yet no signs had been given by\\nthose above that their approach had been observed.\\n\\nSuddenly Duplin paused, and turning his head, upheld his finger in\\nwarning. Then stooping, he whispered to Wythe, who stood just below him:\\n\\n\"Careful, now! I just caught a glimpse of the light. We\\'re close to the\\nspot. Caution Tyrrel. One rash move now may be fatal.\"\\n\\nThough rash and hasty, Tyrrel was by no means a fool, and agreeably\\nsurprised both Wythe and Duplin by his prudence.\\n\\nCautiously, silently as so many shadowy phantoms, the gold-hunters\\ncrept on, until, their heads above the level of a broad ledge, they\\ngazed in upon a peculiarly strange scene. Fairly holding their breath,\\ntheir eyes eagerly drank in every detail.\\n\\nBefore them was a small, low-roofed cavern, dimly lighted up by a rude\\nwooden lamp that sat upon a projecting spur of rock.\\n\\nThere were two occupants; a man and a woman. These first enchained the\\neyes of the gold-hunters.\\n\\nThe first was the man they had observed beside their covert on the\\nopposite hill. The woman was truly a surprise, when viewed in this\\nstrange, wild spot.\\n\\nThat she was young--not more than twenty years of age, if so much--was\\nplain. That she was possessed of a more than ordinary beauty, needed\\nbut a second glance to tell.\\n\\nShe was small, of a graceful figure that even the rude dress she wore\\ncould not entirely disguise. In complexion she was a perfect blonde,\\nwith a profusion of softly-curling yellow hair, that, unconfined, fell\\naround her person almost like a mantle.\\n\\nHer garb, like that worn by the old man, was rough and uncouth,\\ntelling of a long absence from civilization. Her feet were incased in\\nmoccasins, while his feet were bare.\\n\\nThis strange couple were seated near each other, the woman at the\\nwild-man\\'s feet, feeding him as she would have done an overgrown baby,\\nmouthful after mouthful. Neither spoke, and then, with a gesture, the\\nman signified he had sufficient, when the maiden arose and glided away,\\ndisappearing from view of the watchers around a projecting spur of rock.\\n\\nThe old man arose, stretched his limbs and yawned heavily, then sunk\\ndown upon a small pallet of skins, leaving the light still burning. One\\nhand clutched the strung bow, and the quiver of arrows lay close at\\nhand.\\n\\nPaley Duplin turned his head and motioned to his companions. Jack\\nTyrrel at first seemed inclined to demur, but then, as though by second\\nthoughts, he noiselessly began the perilous descent, followed by his\\ncomrades.\\n\\nThis was not accomplished without considerable difficulty, and, indeed,\\nabsolute danger, owing to the deceptive gloom, but, fortunately, the\\ntrio succeeded in gaining the valley in safety. Securing their rifles,\\nthey crossed this, and once more gained their covert, tired out and\\nsore, yet feeling rewarded by the strange discovery they had made.\\n\\nTyrrel alone had little to say. That night\\'s events seemed to have made\\na deep impression upon his mind, and while his comrades discussed the\\nsubject, he remained deep buried in thought.\\n\\nUpon one thing he was determined, though he said nothing to his friends\\nabout it at the time. He must see this strange beauty again, if only to\\nask her if this sort of life was her own choice. Further than this he\\ndid not go, even in his own secret thoughts.\\n\\nIt was now nearly daylight, and the comrades agreed to remain where\\nthey were concealed during that day, lest the emigrants should\\ninstitute a search for them. As all felt the need of repose, the day\\nwas divided into three watches, of which Wythe took the first, Tyrrel\\nthe second, and Duplin the last.\\n\\nAs may well be believed, by far the greater portion of the time, their\\ngaze rested upon the face of the cliff, marveling at the secrets its\\nbosom contained. But little rewarded this scrutiny.\\n\\nTrue, during Burr Wythe\\'s watch, the hermit, wild-man, or whatever\\nelse he might be called, descended the cliff, and set off down the\\nvalley. The young woman had accompanied him to the ledge that served as\\nentrance to the cavern, and kneeling there, watched his progress until\\nthe hill-point concealed him from view. Then, with a long, lingering\\nglance around, she turned and entered the hill-home.\\n\\nWythe questioned whether or no to make known this circumstance to his\\ncomrades, but a fear for Jack Tyrrel\\'s impulsiveness restrained him.\\nThat the young man had been deeply interested in the affair, he could\\nnot doubt, and were he to know that the strange maiden were alone, he\\nmight feel tempted to visit her. By this the reader is not to infer\\nthat he doubted Tyrrel\\'s honor--far from it. But Wythe feared lest his\\nimpulsive nature should get them into trouble with the madman, and thus\\ninterfere with the gold-hunting.\\n\\nThus the day passed away, and it was not until the middle of Duplin\\'s\\nwatch, that any thing of moment occurred. Then he quietly awoke the two\\nmen, bidding them be cautious.\\n\\nPeering through the bushes, they could distinguish a small body of\\nmen, slowly moving across the mouth of the valley, seemingly trailing.\\nThe same thought occurred to each of the three men. Why this long and\\npersistent search? Why delay the wagon-train an entire day to search\\nfor three deserters, whose passage-money had been paid in advance.\\nThis surprised them, even though they had guarded against the chance.\\nThese precautions, however, had been taken wholly upon account of the\\ngold-pocket, not from fear of being forced to return, since they were\\nfree agents, and in no wise bound to the train.\\n\\n\"Ha! look yonder!\" muttered Wythe. \"The wild-man!\"\\n\\nThis strange being could now be seen standing upon a huge bowlder, not\\nfar from the edge of the precipice, evidently confronting the party\\nof emigrants, who had now passed from view beyond the hill-point.\\nCuriously the three men watched his motions.\\n\\nThey heard the report of Nathan Upshur\\'s rifle, saw the wild-man\\nstagger and almost fall, then leap to the ground and dash up the hill.\\nTheir next view of him was as he swung lightly across the almost\\nperpendicular face of the precipice, hanging by the frail vines and\\nshrubbery, or dropping from ledge to ledge, agile and sure-footed as\\nthe mountain-goat itself. Reaching the base, he darted swiftly across\\nthe valley, passing close by the gold-hunters\\' covert, uttering a low,\\ngrowling sound that seemed more like the anger of a wild beast than the\\nvoice of a human being.\\n\\n\"Did you notice?\" muttered Duplin. \"The blood was dripping from his\\nbreast. Those men yonder shot him.\"\\n\\n\"It spatters the rocks out here. If they follow his trail, they must\\ndiscover us,\" added Wythe frowning.\\n\\n\"What difference? We\\'re half white and free-born. They have no control\\nover our actions,\" retorted Tyrrel.\\n\\n\"True; yet this pick-ax, coupled with our desertion, would rouse their\\nsuspicions, or rather direct them into the right channel, and I fear we\\nwould soon have more partners than would be pleasant or profitable. I\\ndon\\'t want to meet them, if I can help it,\" added Duplin.\\n\\nBut their fears proved causeless, for the pursuit of the wild-man\\'s\\ntrail had carried Chicot\\'s party to one side of that left by the\\ndeserters, and that they were so close at hand was unknown to the\\nemigrants. And after a short time the gold-hunters saw their late\\ncomrades turn and retrace their steps, evidently returning to the wagon\\ntrain, without thought of following the wounded man further after the\\nstartling exhibition he had given them of his prowess.\\n\\nJust before sunset they saw the wild-man return apparently but little\\ninjured, and their doubts thus solved, soon after the trio took up\\ntheir march toward the golden valley, where fortune awaited them.\\n\\nNeither noted the extreme care Jack Tyrrel observed in fixing their\\nroute upon his mind. Each rock, hill or valley was closely and\\nthoroughly noted, so that he felt assured that he could find his way\\nback, if needs be, in the darkest night. And find his way back he had\\nresolved he would, sooner or later.\\n\\n\"There!\" at length muttered Duplin, pausing upon a high ridge and\\nstretching one hand toward the valley below him. \"Yonder, boys, lies\\nour fortune!\"\\n\\nThe others did not speak. They stood eagerly gazing downward in the\\ndirection indicated, their eyes glowing, their faces flushed hotly,\\ntheir frames quivering in every fiber. The gold-fever was upon them.\\n\\nAnd, as if infected by their excitement, Duplin lost his composure.\\nWith one accord they rushed headlong down the steep hillside and out\\nupon the level ground. Then Duplin abruptly paused.\\n\\n\"Comrades,\" and the words seemed to issue with difficulty, \"_you are\\nstanding over a bed of gold_!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER IV.\\n\\n                            MABEL GUILFORD.\\n\\n\\nReturning to camp, Chicot\\'s party found that the other bands had\\nalready returned without having discovered any thing. That night the\\nbody of the murdered man was buried, after an earnest discussion as\\nto whether another day should be devoted to a search for the supposed\\ncriminals. Now that the first fervor had cooled down, the vote was\\nalmost unanimous to continue their journey, all fearing lest they\\nshould be caught by the winter storms in the mountains.\\n\\nSo with the dawn of another day the wagon-train once more took up\\nits due progress, toiling wearily along over the dreary trail, only\\ncheered by the thought that each step taken was so much nearer to the\\nfabulous heaps of pure gold that only awaited the gathering. For such\\nwere the wild visions that haunted even the most sensible, during that\\nnever-to-be-forgotten epidemic--the _gold-fever_.\\n\\nFor two days they toiled on, without any event of moment to break the\\nkilling monotony. But then came a second blow, even more crushing\\nthan the one recorded in the preceding pages, because it left the\\nwagon-train without a head--in much the same situation as a vessel\\nwould be on losing the only man capable of steering it aright.\\n\\nIn a word, Paul Chicot suddenly disappeared, without leaving any trace\\nbehind him. At dark he had taken his position among the sentinels. At\\ndaybreak the train was discovered to be totally unguarded! Not only had\\nChicot vanished during the night, but with him had gone two others.\\nThis was just three mornings after the discovery of the first desertion.\\n\\nA few words will explain the circumstances leading to this defection.\\nNathan Upshur was at the bottom of it all. Since his eavesdropping,\\nwhen he learned of the golden pocket discovered by Paley Duplin, he\\nhad been busy shaping a way by which he could gain a share, if not the\\nwhole, of the treasure. And so well had he done his work that no one\\nsuspected his purpose until the blow was dealt.\\n\\nHe knew that he must have companions in the venture, as none of the\\ndeserters would willingly admit him to share in their profits. In fine,\\nthey despised, if not hated him, as he well knew.\\n\\nPaul Chicot was the man he first selected as a comrade, knowing him to\\nbe brave and not over-scrupulous, as well as thoroughly acquainted with\\nthe country for hundreds of miles around. And, too, he knew that he was\\navaricious beyond the common.\\n\\nThe subject was first broached on the night preceding their desertion.\\nUpshur visited the point where Chicot was standing guard, and together\\nthey smoked their pipes, idly conversing. Then Nate suddenly said:\\n\\n\"Why do you follow this life, Paul?\"\\n\\n\"I won\\'t, no longer\\'n I git to the mines. Then I\\'ll go back to St. Joe,\\non the Blacksnake Hills, with gold enough to keep the old woman an\\'\\ngals in fine style. No more trampin\\' fer me _then_--not much.\"\\n\\n\"But if you had an opportunity of getting rich _before_ you went to\\nCalifornia, would you refuse it?\"\\n\\nChicot keenly eyed Upshur, as though seeking to read his secret\\nmeaning, for the man\\'s voice had lowered to a confidential tone, and a\\npeculiar expression rested upon his face.\\n\\n\"That depends--not in such a way as made whoever it was rub out poor\\nDutchy,\" slowly returned Chicot.\\n\\n\"Bah! why bring up such things? Of course, I don\\'t mean any thing of\\nthe sort. But now, for instance, supposing another train would come\\nalong and offer you more--ten times as much as you get for guiding\\n_this_ train--would you accept it?\"\\n\\n\"Be I a fool? Of course I would, onless this \\'ne was to raise thar\\npile. I work for _money_, an\\' the biggest pile takes my eye,\" quietly\\nadded Paul.\\n\\n\"Well then, supposing I could take you to a gold-mine, within a day\\'s\\ntramp from here, would you desert the train? I say only supposing I\\ncould do this.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all bosh. Don\\'t I _know_ thar\\'s none sech \\'round here?\"\\ncontemptuously snorted Chicot.\\n\\n\"But _would_ you?\"\\n\\n\"Yas--in a hurry, too.\"\\n\\n\"Swear it on this,\" and Upshur adroitly twitched a small metal crucifix\\nfrom Chicot\\'s bosom, where it hung by a string. \"Swear to keep all\\nsecret that I tell you now, and never to betray it until I give you\\nfree permission.\"\\n\\nChicot, deeply impressed by Upshur\\'s earnestness, obeyed, though still\\nskeptical. And then, after first carefully assuring himself that there\\nwere no eavesdroppers near, Upshur unfolded his secret, telling all.\\nHow he had first struck scent of the secret, of his eavesdropping,\\nof how he followed the deserters until he had a fair idea of their\\ndestination; of all save his connection with the dastardly blow in the\\ndark, and the attempt to fix the crime upon Burr Wythe, for reasons\\nthat may hereafter appear.\\n\\n\"Now you know all,\" he added, \"and it is for you to decide whether we\\nare to slave on like dogs, while those three, not a whit better than\\nwe, are making themselves rich for life. What do you say?\"\\n\\n\"They\\'d never \\'gree to share \\'th us,\" muttered Paul, reflectively, yet\\nwith his eyes glowing and his breath quickening.\\n\\n\"They _must_, if we say so. I, for one, am willing to fight for it.\\nJust think--Duplin said he found nuggets as large as his fist! And\\nhundreds of them, too! Just think, man--why, there\\'s enough to make us\\nthe richest men in the United States! They must share--_or else we\\'ll\\ntake the whole_!\"\\n\\n\"That\\'ll be the best way,\" hoarsely added Chicot, now fully yielding to\\nthe power of the yellow fiend. \"There won\\'t be enough for all--fer we\\nmust take another. They\\'re strong men, and will fight fer their--fer\\n_our_ gold. It is ours--it _must_ be ours!\"\\n\\n\"Good! but the other--who shall we select?\"\\n\\n\"Tim Dooley--I know him well. For gold he would pawn his soul to the\\ndevil--and then blarney him out of his pay afterward.\"\\n\\nAnd so it was settled. On the succeeding night the three men, who were\\nstanding guard, deserted and took up the back-trail, forgetful of\\nthe dangers that threatened the wagon-train in being left without a\\ncompetent guide. Upshur chuckled with devilish glee as he hoped the\\nworst would befall them.\\n\\nHe had proposed to Lottie Mitchell, and she had rejected him. Her\\nfather also had forbidden him ever again addressing his child, under\\npenalty of a thrashing. For this reason, seeing that all hope of\\nsuccess in that direction was gone, he hoped that the entire train\\nmight be attacked and destroyed by the Indians or mountain outlaws,\\nthat infested the Overland Route, almost from end to end.\\n\\nCaleb Mitchell was at his wit\\'s end when the truly alarming tidings\\nwere generally made known on the morning following Chicot\\'s\\ndisappearance. And not without good cause for apprehension, for the\\ntrain was now fairly in among the mountains, where a deviation from the\\nright trail--at times wholly undiscernible--might well result in total\\ndestruction.\\n\\nAs wagon-master, head of the train, only second to the regular guide,\\nhe was naturally the one to whom all now looked, when in truth he was\\nno more capable than any other member, except from his great coolness\\nand superior judgment. All were equally ignorant of the trail, since\\nthis was the first venture across the plains.\\n\\nMitchell\\'s first move was to send in pursuit of the deserters, with\\norders to bring them in at all hazards, if found. That last clause was\\nwell put in, for Paul Chicot had an easy task in that wild, broken\\nregion, in blinding his trail, so that all pursuit was useless. And,\\nwith so many long hours the start, it was like sending a horse to run\\ndown the locomotive.\\n\\nLong after dark, the different bands straggled in, weary and dejected.\\nNot even a foot-trace had been found to indicate the direction in which\\nthe deserters had gone: and now, that faint hope gone, the greater\\nportion of the emigrants gave way to despair.\\n\\nIn vain Mitchell strove to cheer them up. He said that it was only a\\nmatter of time and patience; that before long some other train must\\ncome along which they could join. But the answer came, quick and\\ncrushing, because it was the one that was chilling his own heart.\\n\\nIt was late in the season. Their train, drawn wholly by oxen, had been\\nlong upon the road, and the halt at the \"sick-camp\" had still further\\ndelayed them. They might be the last train on the road--very probably\\nwere, since the mountains of California could not be crossed after\\nwinter set in. A train might not come along until the spring--and that\\nwould be too late. How many of the party could live through a winter in\\nthe mountains? The looked-for train would only find their bones.\\n\\nHarassed by such arguments and fears as these, Caleb Mitchell resolved\\nupon a bold course, and yet apparently the only one that was left them.\\nHe would make the attempt to guide the train through the mountains\\nhimself, at least until they could gain a spot more favorable for a\\nwinter\\'s residence than here, if worst came to worst.\\n\\nFearing to lose more precious time, long before daybreak the next day,\\nthe wagon-train was slowly following the lead of Caleb Mitchell, who\\nrode in advance, his heart troubled with fears and doubts, for behind\\nhim was the sole remaining tie that made life dear to him, and its fate\\nin a great measure depended upon his skill and prudence.\\n\\nSeveral hours later, as he saw the crest of a rocky hill, over which\\nthe trail led, he abruptly reined in his horse and gazed keenly across\\nthe valley before him. He had distinguished the slowly-moving form\\nof human beings, evidently afoot, and the hope that these were the\\nreturning deserters set his heart afire.\\n\\nBut all too soon this delusion was dispelled, for he now could\\ndistinguish the flowing drapery of _a woman_. Anxiously enough he\\nawaited their approach, but as they paused on discovering his figure\\noutlined against the clear sky, he impatiently rode forward. He could\\nnow see that there were only two, and the formation of the trail forbid\\nthe supposition of an ambush being possible there.\\n\\nAs he approached them, the man stood before the woman, with drawn and\\nleveled pistol, a look of stern despair imprinted upon his worn but\\nhandsome features. His voice rung with the desperation of a hunted\\nfugitive turned at bay, as he spoke:\\n\\n\"Keep your distance--we will not be taken alive.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean? Who\\'s trying to take you alive--or dead either, for\\nthat matter?\" ejaculated Mitchell, surprised at the man\\'s tone and\\naction.\\n\\n\"Then you don\\'t--you\\'re not one of those from whom we escaped? You\\nhaven\\'t been chasing us?\" doubtfully added the stranger.\\n\\n\"Scarcely--else I would not be coming from this direction,\" laughed\\nMitchell. \"You have nothing to fear from me, if it is as I surmise. I\\nclaim to be a gentleman, though in rather rough guise just now--but\\nthat matters little. Yonder comes my train. You are welcome to all it\\naffords, sir. As for the lady, my daughter will be pleased to supply\\nher wants as far as she can.\"\\n\\n\"Thank God!\" murmured the woman, springing forward, and, seizing\\nMitchell\\'s hardened hand, she moistened it with tears. \"You will\\nprotect us from that--from those dreadful men?\"\\n\\n\"With my life, lady,\" warmly returned the wagon-master, deeply\\naffected, yet feeling not a little curiosity regarding the strangers,\\nwondering to what he was pledging himself, and who \"those dreadful men\"\\ncould be.\\n\\n\"You are very kind, sir, but my heart is too full of gratitude to\\nthank you now as you deserve. When you hear our sad story, you will\\nnot wonder that we are weary and worn out and need rest. Bear up,\\ndaughter--we are safe with good friends, at last!\"\\n\\n\"But, father--these men--they must have perceived us?\" answered the\\nwoman, tremblingly.\\n\\n\"Perhaps not, but--\"\\n\\n\"If there is any danger, sir, tell me what it is, so that I can put\\nmy friends upon their guard. We all know how to handle a rifle, and\\nit must be a strong force to trouble us while on guard,\" proudly\\ninterrupted Mitchell.\\n\\n\"There may be danger, but I hardly think it will come near. We were\\npursued by a party of mountain outlaws, at least until a short time\\nsince. But they don\\'t number over a dozen, at most. They would never\\ndare attack here, unless joined by their comrades at the Retreat.\"\\n\\n\"We will be on the look-out for them. But you must need refreshments.\\nSuch as we can offer is at your command. After that, I should like to\\nhear your story. Naturally, this strange meeting has greatly excited my\\ncuriosity.\"\\n\\n\"I do not need much--only a drink of water, or something stronger, if\\nit is handy. As for my daughter Mabel, here, she is entirely worn out.\\nIf you will be so kind--you spoke of a daughter?\"\\n\\n\"I will introduce them. Though Lottie is far from well--her poor\\nmother\\'s death has nearly killed the child--she will gladly do all that\\nis in her power to comfort your daughter.\"\\n\\n\"I too have lost my mother,\" softly murmured Mabel, her large eyes\\nfilling with tears, as she glanced up into the stalwart emigrant\\'s face.\\n\\n\"Poor child!\" muttered Mitchell, yielding to a sudden and\\nuncontrollable impulse, and bending low in his saddle, he imprinted a\\nfatherly kiss upon the smooth white forehead of the maiden.\\n\\nMabel\\'s face flushed, but she did not appear to take offense at the\\nabrupt action, though she cast a swift glance toward her father. Then,\\nwith an effort, Mitchell recovered himself, and soon explained the\\nfacts of the strange meeting to the wondering emigrants, the train\\nhaving caught up during the delay.\\n\\nMabel was kindly greeted by Lottie, and then the white-tilted wagons\\nhid them from view. The father was furnished with the beverage he\\ndesired, and then, seemingly forgetful of fatigue and weariness in his\\nanxiety for the welfare of the wagon-train, he rode along ahead of the\\ntrain on Mitchell\\'s horse, while the latter walked.\\n\\n\"You say you have no regular guide?\"\\n\\n\"He deserted us night before last,\" moodily replied Mitchell, his brow\\nlowering.\\n\\n\"Can it be that he is in league with these devils?\" mused the other,\\nhalf to himself. \"It looks black--very black!\"\\n\\nMitchell glanced impatiently at his companion. These vague hints were\\nalarming, when coupled with the still unexplained appearance of the\\ncouple in that wild and apparently unsettled region.\\n\\n\"Mr. Mitchell,\" abruptly uttered the stranger, \"I am about to tell\\nyou a very strange story, and you would do well to listen to it very\\nclosely, as, if I mistake not, it concerns you and yours deeply. First,\\nmy name is Guilford; I am a retired officer of the regular army, and\\nMabel is my only child. Why we left a comfortable home in the East to\\njourney overland to California, does not matter just now--suffice that\\nwe did.\\n\\n\"The wagon-train which we joined passed over this spot full two weeks\\nago. Thus far, all had worked smoothly and agreeably. The company was a\\nstrong one, formed of intelligent and agreeable people. The guide was\\nthoroughly capable, and gave perfect satisfaction. And yet--I and my\\nchild alone remain to tell the fate of all that company!\"\\n\\nMitchell could not repress a cry of horror.\\n\\n\"Wait. You must have heard of the devils in human shape that haunt\\nportions of the overland trail? Though they do not often attack full\\ntrains, they do much of the mischief that is wrongly attributed to the\\nIndians, disguising themselves as such, the better to carry out their\\nnefarious schemes. Well, we fell into the hands of a company of these\\ndemons.\\n\\n\"Our guide betrayed us. As I now know, he belonged to the band of\\noutlaws, and only joined our train to betray it into the clutches of\\nhis comrades. All that he done, I learned afterward. No one suspected\\nhis fidelity until all was lost.\\n\\n\"He led us from the right trail. None thought of doubting him, and we\\nwalked blindly into the trap. I was mostly in company with Mabel, who\\nwas just recovering from a fit of illness, else I might have detected\\nthe change, for I had once before passed over the route.\\n\\n\"Well, just before dusk, the end came. The foremost wagon was suddenly\\nchecked by a rocky barricade, that completely filled the narrow\\npassage. The guide had vanished. Then came the shock, as the teamsters\\nand passengers flocked ahead to see what was wrong.\\n\\n\"From the hillside above us came a deadly storm of rifle and\\npistol-bullets. On every side was death. Not a foeman was to be seen,\\nand yet the withering storm swept man after man to death. And not alone\\nthe men. Women and children, even the toddling babes, were shot down.\\nNone were spared. In ten minutes all was over.\\n\\n\"Taken so by surprise what could we do? Nothing. Scarcely one had a\\nweapon at hand. Such as had, were too astounded to think of using them.\\nAnd even had this been different, what could they have done when not\\na foeman was visible? The rocks above seemed to be raining down death\\nupon us. Not a form could be seen; not a voice mingled with the din of\\nfire-arms, save from the dying as they fell in heaps. My God! it was\\nterrible!\" and Guilford covered his eyes and groaned aloud as one in\\nmental agony.\\n\\n\"Pardon my emotion, Mr. Mitchell. Though an old soldier, never before\\nhad I witnessed such a frightful sight. My heart bleeds again at the\\nmere thought.\" And Guilford shuddered again.\\n\\n\"But you--how did you escape unhurt?\" curiously asked Mitchell.\\n\\n\"I can explain that now, though at the time I believed it a proof\\nof Providence. But that was part of the plan. I spoke of our guide.\\nThat man was none other than the chief of the outlaws. He had joined\\nus and acted as guide, the better to entrap us. He was a handsome,\\ndashing fellow and it seems now that he took a sudden fancy to my\\ndaughter--curse the villain!\\n\\n\"I was with Mabel, in the wagon, and he knew this. He pointed it out\\nto his men, and cautioned them against injuring its inmates. With\\nthe first shot, I started to give my aid to our friends, but Mabel,\\nhalf-crazed, seized me, and I dared not leave her. It would have killed\\nher, in her weak state.\\n\\n\"When the guide came to the wagon and ordered us to dismount, I\\nrealized the truth, and fired at him. But in my haste, the bullet that\\nshould have bored his treacherous brain, missed its mark, killing a man\\nstanding just beyond him. I was seized and bound, though I struggled\\ndesperately. Only for the guide--Yellow Jack--I would have been killed\\non the spot. But he had a purpose for saving me, for that time. Through\\nher love for me, he hoped to bend my daughter to his will.\\n\\n\"We--Mabel and I--were carried away into the mountains, and so were\\nspared the horrible scene that must have followed. Yellow Jack told me\\nof it, afterward. The wounded were put out of their misery, and then\\ntossed down a deep ravine hard by, where the wolves and vultures would\\nsoon hide them from mortal sight. The wagons were burned, after being\\nplundered, and the ashes scattered to the winds. All traces of the\\nhorrible massacre were obliterated, leaving the trap ready for other\\nvictims.\\n\\n\"Well, \\'tis an unpleasant subject to dwell upon, and I hasten on\\nas fast as possible, yet telling all that is necessary for you to\\nunderstand the matter. We--Mabel and I--were taken to the hill retreat\\nof this Yellow Jack, and were, for a time at least, treated reasonably\\nwell. Then, however, as Mabel gave no signs of softening her manner\\ntoward him, he began to show his devilish nature by torturing her with\\nfears for me. Finally, he gave her two days to decide; either to become\\nhis bride or see me murdered before her very eyes.\\n\\n\"But we had a friend that he little suspected, in his wife--a beautiful\\nwoman who appeared to fairly worship the monster. The fear that Mabel\\nwould entirely supplant her in Yellow Jack\\'s love, gave her the courage\\nto foil his purpose by a daring stroke. In the middle of the night she\\nset us both free and led us beyond the line of guards, then giving us\\nthe clue to finding the trail, she bade us begone--to suffer death\\nrather than recapture, for after this her hands would be tied. She gave\\nme these pistols, and a small package of food. Then she left us.\\n\\n\"We journeyed by night, and lay hid among the rocks by day, well\\nknowing that we would be pursued, and that the entire country would be\\nscoured. To-day, for the first time, we ventured forth during daylight.\\nYou know the rest--how we found you, and how warmly we were welcomed by\\nall,\" concluded Guilford, evidently deeply affected.\\n\\n\"Then, if this band is so near, this train is in danger!\" uttered\\nMitchell, in a troubled tone.\\n\\n\"No, I think not. The band is not strong enough to openly attack such\\na train, and they would scarcely dare to form an ambush along the\\n_regular_ trail. We only suffered through our traitorous guide. You are\\nsafe so long as you keep the main trail and see that your sentinels do\\nnot neglect their duty. True, you may chance to lose some stock, and\\ncare must be taken that stragglers do not wander far from the train,\\nelse the outlaws might wreak their spite upon them.\"\\n\\n\"But our guide is gone--has deserted. How do we know whether we keep\\nthe right trail or not? Indeed, we may be straggling from it this very\\nmoment!\"\\n\\n\"You are right so far. The only danger of straying will be during the\\nnext two or three days. After that the route is plain and broad. But do\\nyou mean to say that you are _all_ new hands--that there are none here\\nwho have ever passed over the trail before?\"\\n\\n\"That is the fact.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we must do the best we can. Though I have made one trip before\\nthis, I paid comparatively little attention to the trace, and don\\'t\\nsuppose my judgment is much, if any, better than yours. Still, between\\nus, I think we can manage to pick out the right course.\"\\n\\nMeantime the two maidens, Lottie Mitchell and Mabel Guilford, had\\nalready become fast friends, and picturing great enjoyment in each\\nother\\'s company during the remainder of the journey.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER V.\\n\\n                        WHERE WAS JACK TYRREL?\\n\\n\\nOver a bed of gold.\\n\\nThe three gold-seekers were indeed in the valley of treasure. A few\\nhours of earnest work in the \"pocket\" revealed riches beyond account,\\nand so infatuated did all become with the results of their labor that\\nscarcely could the one detailed to the daily service of hunting for\\nfood take the time necessary to procure proper supplies.\\n\\nNothing had occurred to disturb their intense labors, although more\\nthan once the hunter for the day had come across strange tracks in\\nthe vicinity of their golden bed, and the soul-sickening dread that\\nassailed Robinson Crusoe, on his desert isle, now found a resting\\nplace in their hearts. They fancied this was the track of some\\nmalicious-minded enemy who was watching them with the intention of\\nrobbing the golden store that had grown daily more and more dear to\\nthem.\\n\\nA sad change had come over the trio. Their friends and loved ones would\\nscarcely have recognized them, even after these few days of success.\\nPale, haggard, and hollow-eyed, they toiled on almost unceasingly,\\nscarce speaking a word through the livelong day, even seeming\\nsuspicious of each other, sleeping fitfully, often awaking with a\\nstart as if from some haunting dream to glare at the spot where their\\ntreasure was hoarded away. A sad, sad change, and one that was daily\\ngrowing more and more apparent.\\n\\nDay by day, hour by hour, the insidious _gold-fever_ was gaining in\\npower over them, crushing out all generous thoughts, tightening its\\ngrasp upon their heart-strings, until scarce one trace of their former\\nselves was left.\\n\\nNearly a week had elapsed since their arrival at the valley of gold. It\\nwas night, and though the past day had been one of almost breathless\\ntoil, the three adventurers sat awake and sleepless, smoking their\\npipes in silence beneath the rude, frail shelter of vine-clad brush.\\n\\nAll without was dark and dismal. The air was charged with electricity,\\nand the comrades found it impossible to sleep. All nature seemed\\nfeverish and ill at ease.\\n\\nThe moon was obscured; dense sulphurous masses of clouds swirled\\nathwart the horizon in wild confusion. Low, sullen mutterings filled\\nthe air. A tempest was brewing.\\n\\nSilently smoking, the gold-hunters watched the play of the clouds. They\\nseemed to care little for the result. What mattered it though they did\\nget wet? The rain could not injure their golden treasure, and what else\\nhad they to care for? Nothing.\\n\\nSuddenly Paley Duplin sprung half erect, outstretching one hand as the\\npipe dropped unheeded at his feet. His voice sounded strangely excited,\\ntrembling violently.\\n\\n\"My God! look yonder--that light!\"\\n\\nFar up the bed of the one-time water-course, a light seemed slowly\\nmoving to and fro. This, of itself, in that lone and desolate spot, was\\nenough to excite wonder. But it was the _shape_ the light gradually\\nassumed as it drew nearer that caused Duplin agitation.\\n\\nSpeechless the three men glared at the vision as it slowly drew nearer\\nto where they sat. Neither spoke. They seemed petrified with horror.\\n\\nAnd well might this be the case. The past week had sadly weakened their\\nnerves. This horrible reserve that had come over them since delving\\namidst the masses of gold, had rendered them doubly susceptible to\\nsuperstitious influence.\\n\\nThey could no longer doubt. The shape, glowing with a ghastly light,\\nwas now vividly outlined.\\n\\nBefore them, at only a few rods\\' distance, stood a skeleton of fire!\\n\\nA skeleton, perfect in the most minute detail. It seemed of gigantic\\nsize, as though the relic of some long since extinct race of giants.\\n\\nThe brainless skull, the eyeless sockets, the wide, ghastly-grinning\\nmouth and blazing teeth, the body, the arms and legs, all were glowing\\nwith a strangely-weird luster, not unlike that produced by the use of\\nphosphorus. One fleshless arm was slowly lifted until the dangling\\nfinger pointed directly at the spot where crouched the gold-hunters,\\nawe-stricken and speechless.\\n\\nAnd still the flaming skeleton advanced, more and more, the arm\\nwarningly outstretched, the skull wearing that horribly mocking grin.\\n\\nSuddenly a low, taunting laugh echoed upon the still oppressive air--a\\nlaugh that seemed to issue from the fleshless lips.\\n\\nDuplin shuddered, and bowing his head, covered his face as if to shut\\nout the sickening object. Wythe and Tyrrel remained motionless, their\\neyes riveted upon the skeleton.\\n\\nA voice uttering words followed the laugh. Deep yet low, something\\nstrangely impressive when coming from that ghastly spectacle, as it\\nappeared.\\n\\n\"Blind fools! ye are trespassing here on holy ground. Depart while yet\\nthere is time. You hear--even the spirits of the air warn you. Obey\\ntheir voice--flee--flee from the wrath to come! Take heed. \\'Tis the\\nlast warning. Depart--or the morrow\\'s sun shall shine down on your\\nlifeless remains.\"\\n\\nA laugh slowly followed this speech, coming from the rude hut of\\nbushes. It was from Jack Tyrrel, sounding strained, yet scornful.\\n\\n\"This mummery has gone far enough,\" he said, in a tone that told of\\nrising anger. \"It\\'s my turn now. Whoever you are, _you_ take warning.\\nIn just one minute, unless you drop that mask, I\\'ll try if you are\\nbullet-proof. Mark _my_ words, now!\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t, Jack--for God\\'s sake don\\'t!\" gasped Duplin. \"\\'Tis nothing\\nearthly--it\\'s a warning from the other world!\"\\n\\n\"Bah! I\\'ve seen a skeleton doctored with phosphorus before now.\"\\n\\n\"Lift your arm against the dead, and it will drop withered to your\\nside,\" solemnly added the voice.\\n\\n\"It will, eh? Here\\'s to try it. Man or devil--here\\'s greeting to you!\"\\nrecklessly cried Tyrrel, as he raised and sighted his revolver.\\n\\nAgain came the laugh, hollow and unearthly. The fleshless face seemed\\nto grin more horribly than before.\\n\\nOnce--twice the pistol spoke spitefully, the flash momentarily lighting\\nup the little brush shanty, then leaving it in still deeper darkness\\nfrom force of contrast. And yet the skeleton stood there, motionless,\\nsave that the arm appeared to move derisively.\\n\\nThe laugh again echoed forth, as the reverberating reports died away.\\nDuplin sunk upon his face, groaning in terror. Wythe knelt as though\\npetrified. Tyrrel turned a shade paler.\\n\\n\"Silly fool! you provoke your fate. When the sun rises you will be\\ndead--_dead_.\"\\n\\nThe glowing figure swiftly moved forward, and seemed about to attack\\nthe gold-hunters. Jack hastily lifted his pistol and fired, then sprung\\nto his feet as though in readiness for the struggle.\\n\\nWhen the smoke-cloud lifted, he rubbed his eyes in amazement. All was\\nblack before him. Nothing was to be seen. The apparition had vanished\\nas though swallowed up by the earth.\\n\\nOnly for a moment did he hesitate. Then, still clutching his pistol, he\\ndarted from the shanty and glanced around him. All was vacancy.\\n\\nHe leaped upon the sand-bank, and swept his eyes around. The result was\\nthe same. No light--nothing save a far-distant flash of lurid lightning.\\n\\nA disinterested spectator would have laughed outright, could he have\\nseen Tyrrel\\'s face at that moment, so full of blank amazement was it.\\nAnd yet there was nothing in it of superstitious fear.\\n\\nOnly for the first few moments had Jack yielded to this feeling, and\\nthen simply because his comrades had done so. This quickly vanished\\nand anger took its place. He was startled at the new effect of his\\nshots, because he had great confidence in his own skill. Then, too,\\nhe marveled greatly at the abrupt disappearance, but that he wisely\\nattributed to clever skill.\\n\\nThoughtfully scratching his curly pate, Jack retraced his steps and\\nentered the shanty. In silence he lighted his pipe at the still\\nsmoldering embers, and then puffed away vigorously, covertly eying his\\ncomrades the while.\\n\\n\"Well, boys,\" he at length uttered, between puffs, \"what d\\' you think\\nof it, anyhow?\"\\n\\n\"It is gone, then?\" muttered Duplin, in a husky voice.\\n\\n\"Yes--cleverly, too. A smart chap, whoever it may be,\" quoth Tyrrel.\\n\\n\"You are wrong--it was nothing mortal. It was a warning,\" gloomily\\nadded Duplin.\\n\\n\"Now don\\'t be a fool, Paley,\" impatiently. \"The days are passed for\\nsuch melo-dramatic visions as that. We will live to see a great many\\nto-morrows. It is nothing but a very stale trick got up to frighten us\\nfrom our work. Somebody has got wind of our discovery, and takes this\\nplan to drive us away. But I, for one, don\\'t scare worth a cent! And as\\nfirst move--before it rains--I\\'m going to see what sort of track that\\n_ghost_ left behind him. The sand out yonder is soft, and will retain a\\nfootprint. Come--you\\'ll admit that a _spirit_--even though it assumes\\nthe guise of a burning skeleton--can not leave a natural footprint?\\nVery well. If I do not find the tracks of a _man_ out yonder, I\\'ll\\nagree to believe in your view, and at once make my will, provided\\nyou promise the same. If the track _is_ there you\\'ll give up those\\nsuperstitious ideas?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" was the reply given by both Duplin and Wythe.\\n\\nJack said no more, but set about arranging a torch in order to settle\\nthe question once for all. Meantime Wythe had directed Duplin\\'s\\nattention to something not far from the shanty, apparently lying upon\\nthe ground.\\n\\nThis was a small point of flame, flickering vividly, now larger, now\\nsmaller. It was near where the skeleton had stood.\\n\\nTyrrel soon emerged, holding the torch before him, but as he advanced,\\nthe point of flame grew dim, and then vanished entirely. Bending low\\ndown, he began closely scanning the ground, while Duplin and Wythe\\nintently watched his motions.\\n\\n\"You\\'re cornered now, boys,\" he said aloud, with a laugh, rising erect.\\n\"Come out here and own up that you\\'ve been silly fools. Here are the\\ntracks as plain and clear as mud.\"\\n\\nBeginning to feel ashamed of their exhibition, the two soon joined\\nTyrrel, and kneeling, slowly scanned the ground. As Jack had said, the\\nsand was soft, and easily retained the imprint of a human foot.\\n\\nAnd such an imprint lay before them, plain and unmistakable. Even\\nDuplin could no longer doubt that all this had been the work of a\\ncunning hand, though by no means a spirit.\\n\\n\"And see,\" laughed Jack, \"here\\'s a memento of our ghostly visitor. A\\nfinger-joint that one of my bullets has broken.\"\\n\\n\"That was what we saw lying here. Hold it in the dark, Jack--yes, that\\nis it,\" muttered Wythe, as the bone again showed the flickering light.\\n\\n\"And there comes the rain--but first, I\\'m going to have the measure of\\nthis foot. I think I owe the rascal that made it a sound thrashing, and\\nif we ever meet, he\\'ll get it, or my name\\'s not Jack Tyrrel!\"\\n\\nAs the storm burst, the gold-hunters regained their shelter, and\\ncomposed themselves as comfortably as circumstances would admit.\\nKnowing that they were in for a drenching, they only cared to keep\\ntheir weapons and ammunition dry.\\n\\nIt was impossible to sleep while the storm raged with such violence,\\nand Jack continued his good work by lecturing his comrades. He showed\\nthem the point toward which they were drifting, and that ruin must\\nfollow unless they rallied against the spell that seemed falling upon\\nthem.\\n\\n\"Why, in less than a month--if this sort o\\' thing keeps on--we\\'ll be\\nready to cut each other\\'s throats. It is _horrible_! I\\'d rather turn\\nmy back on the gold altogether and live poor all my life than to pass\\nanother week as this one has been.\"\\n\\n\"I agree with you, Jack,\" warmly replied Duplin. \"There is gold enough\\nfor us all. Let\\'s clasp hands, and forget the hard work. Hereafter\\nlet\\'s be _men_--not savage dogs.\"\\n\\n\"Amen!\"\\n\\nThrough that livelong night the three, comrades once more, conversed\\nearnestly. And when day came, they were ready for work.\\n\\nIt was plain now that their secret was no longer _their_ secret--that\\nthey had been watched by some one who knew of their rich discovery. And\\nit was likely that this watcher also knew of their \"bank\"--the spot\\nwhere their treasure was stowed away.\\n\\nBefore daylight they removed the gold to another spot, the driving rain\\nobliterating all traces as soon as made. This done, they looked to\\ntheir weapons.\\n\\nThe spy, whoever he might be, must be found, though a week was spent\\nin searching for him. Only for the beating rain, this would have been\\na comparatively easy matter, since the ground, clear to the hills, was\\nvery favorable for trailing.\\n\\nDay broke clear and beautiful, and Duplin experienced a peculiar thrill\\nof joyous thankfulness as he beheld the brilliant sun roll above the\\neastern swells. The sight gave him renewed life, and the last lingering\\ntrace of superstition vanished.\\n\\nFor hours the three friends sought in vain for some trace of their\\nnocturnal visitor, but it was not until they crossed the first ridge\\nthat such rewarded their search. Then, deeply imprinted in the moist\\nsandy loam, they came upon a double trail, though both sets of tracks\\nwere evidently made by the same person, probably in going and coming,\\nas they trod different ways.\\n\\n\"It\\'s our man,\" cried Jack, as he arose from comparing his tally with\\nthe tracker. \"We must run him to ground, now. He can\\'t be far--these\\ntracks are fresh.\"\\n\\n\"But which are the latest?\"\\n\\n\"That puzzles me. I\\'m not much on the trail-hunt. Chicot could tell,\\nno doubt, but I can\\'t. We must follow both. You and Wythe take that\\ndirection, and I\\'ll look to this.\"\\n\\n\"But there may be danger to you going alone. We don\\'t know who or what\\nthis fellow is. Best keep together.\"\\n\\n\"And so lose the game, like as not? No. I think I can hold my own,\\nsince there\\'s only one man. Go on--and if _you_ find the game, build a\\nfire of grass that will send up a black smoke. I\\'ll do the same. Look\\nout for it.\"\\n\\nIt was rank folly attempting to reason with Tyrrel, and his comrades,\\nwell knew that. So parting--none of the trio dreamed of the time that\\nwould elapse before their meeting!--they each bent to their work.\\n\\nThe trail ran lengthwise along the valley, only divided from that where\\nlay the golden bed by a high ridge. Duplin and Wythe were heading\\nsouth-east; the trail followed by Tyrrel was in an opposite direction.\\n\\n\"I think I can tell just how this will end,\" muttered Burr, after\\nprogressing a mile or more. \"I think we will find the stopping-place\\non yonder point, where we can look down upon our camp. If so, we must\\nhasten back, and join Jack. The hot-headed fellow may get into trouble.\"\\n\\nA few minutes more proved their surmise to be correct. The trail\\ndoubled at the hill, and then ran back for a ways, side by side.\\n\\nThe friends had no difficulty in retracing their steps, and advanced at\\na half run. The damp earth had retained deep tracks.\\n\\nIn ten minutes they had regained the point where Tyrrel had left them,\\nand still hastened after him. Then they paused, simultaneously uttering\\na low cry.\\n\\n\"Too late!\" gasped Duplin.\\n\\nFaint and indistinct came to their ears, borne by the favoring breeze,\\ntwo quickly succeeding pistol-shots, closely followed by a cry, as of\\npain or mortal terror. These sounds came from up the valley.\\n\\nClutching their weapons, the friends bounded forward at top speed,\\ntheir faces pale, their teeth tightly clenched. They feared the worst.\\n\\n\"My God! look there!\" gasped Wythe, extending one trembling hand.\\n\\nBefore them, close to where the rocks that thickly covered the hillside\\nbegan, the ground was torn and trampled, as though the scene of a\\ndesperate struggle for life. And upon one side of a whitely bleached\\nbowlder was a large crimson stain.\\n\\nA stain that could only be produced by _blood_!\\n\\nSick and faint the comrades stood there, wildly glancing around,\\nlistening anxiously for some sound to guide them. But it came not. All\\nwas stilled save their deep, husky breathing.\\n\\n\"Come,\" cried Duplin, with an effort rousing himself, \"this is folly.\\nWe must work. Dead or alive, we must find Jack, and either rescue or\\n_avenge_ him.\"\\n\\nDreading lest at every step they should come upon the dead and mangled\\nbody of their friend hidden among the rocks, the gold-hunters advanced.\\nHere and there a blood-splash guided their eyes. Drop by drop it\\nled them up the hillside. This alone guided them. The flinty ground\\nretained no trace of footsteps.\\n\\nA gore-stained rock attracted them. Rushing forward, Duplin uttered a\\nlow cry. Then he sunk upon his knees and bent forward.\\n\\nBurr Wythe turned sick at heart, and staggering, would have fallen but\\nfor the friendly support of a jagged bowlder. A cry broke from his lips\\nas he started back and removed his hand. It had entered a tiny pool of\\nfresh blood!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER VI.\\n\\n                        LOST IN THE LABYRINTH.\\n\\n\\nWith a convulsive shudder, Burr Wythe wiped the clotted blood from his\\nhand. Duplin, startled by the cry of his comrade, quickly turned his\\nhead.\\n\\n\"What is it, Wythe?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing--I rested my hand in that blood yonder. But what is this--a\\ncave?\"\\n\\n\"It must be--and see! There are blood-stains on the inside edges of\\nthe rock. Whoever, one or many, have gone in there, taking poor Jack\\nwith them, either dead or alive,\" muttered Paley, as he drew back and\\ncarefully looked to his weapons.\\n\\n\"Then out of it they must come,\" determinedly returned Burr, his eyes\\nglittering.\\n\\n\"But how? If in there, they have the advantage of us in every respect.\"\\n\\n\"There is only one way. We must enter and do the best we can.\"\\n\\n\"It looks like suicide, after what we see here; but if you dare risk\\nit, I will not fail you. We can not desert the lad. He would risk as\\nmuch for either of us.\"\\n\\n\"Here--let me pass in first. I can get some idea of what is before us,\\nand if they mean mischief, they\\'ll wait to make sure of us both. Do you\\nkeep back from the entrance, but ready to assist me if I call.\"\\n\\nPale but resolute, Wythe crawled into the hole, and then glanced\\nquickly around him, as though in hopes of being able to penetrate\\nthe dense gloom. That his heart beat quicker than common, is no\\ndisparagement to his courage, for there is nothing so trying as facing\\nan unknown danger _in the dark_.\\n\\nFeeling around he found several pebbles, and flung them violently from\\nhim. From their faint echoes, he learned what he desired.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a large cave, Paley,\" he uttered, as he emerged into the open\\nair. \"We must not enter without material for torches. We might pass\\nwithin arm\\'s length of poor Jack, and not know it.\"\\n\\nThoroughly determined to find their missing comrade, and if possible\\nthose who had struck this blow, the two men scarcely gave a thought now\\nto the danger they might be incurring, nor how completely they would\\nbe at the mercy of any hidden enemy, while they were bearing lighted\\ntorches. So, while Wythe guarded the cave entrance, Duplin hastily\\ncollected material for torches.\\n\\nA few minutes sufficed for this, and then both men entered the hole.\\nThus shielded from the wind, they soon succeeded in kindling a torch,\\nand then, while one held it aloft, the other kept just without the\\ncircle of light, with cocked and ready revolver. In this manner one at\\nleast would be running less risk. Duplin, as being the best shot, held\\nthe latter position.\\n\\nThe two friends curiously glanced around them. But little was to be\\nseen, save the jagged roof of rock, as the torch emitted but a feeble\\nlight.\\n\\nStill, a few moments showed them that the chamber in which they stood\\nwas untenanted save by themselves. It was of considerable size,\\nirregular in outline, rough and jagged, with a low roof or ceiling.\\n\\n\"Look! here is a sort of tunnel,\" muttered Wythe, waving the light\\nbefore him. \"And--yes! here goes the blood-drops. Poor Jack! if it\\'s\\n_his_ blood, he must be dead.\"\\n\\n\"Maybe not. A little makes a big show on rock. But let\\'s hasten--I\\'m\\neager for the end. Any thing--even the knowledge of his death, is\\nbetter than this suspense.\"\\n\\n\"If he _is_ dead, somebody must pay for it!\" gritted Wythe,\\nvindictively.\\n\\nThe tunnel was low and narrow, and the explorers had to stoop their\\nheads to avoid the rocky roof. More than once Wythe fancied he could\\ndistinguish the trace of tools wielded by human hands upon the soft\\nrock, but other thoughts occupied their minds, though at another time\\nthis fact would have excited the deepest curiosity.\\n\\nThe tunnel was winding, now sheering abruptly to the right, then\\nagain to the left, and several times Wythe paused in doubt, as _two_\\npassages met his gaze. But a close and cautious scrutiny would show a\\ndrop of blood upon the floor of one or the other, and thus guided, the\\nadventurers pressed on, further into the labyrinth, without a thought\\nof their own peril--thinking only of their lost comrade. From first to\\nlast, of that day, they exhibited a strange lack of prudence.\\n\\nTheir progress, owing to these causes, was slow--far more so than, in\\ntheir impatience to learn the fate of Jack Tyrrel, they believed--and\\nthe winding passage frequently caused them to almost retrace their\\nfootsteps.\\n\\nSuddenly Wythe came to the end of the tunnel, and stepped into what\\nseemed a spacious chamber, though he could only judge from the\\ndifference in the atmosphere. The torch was of little service, save\\nwithin a radius of several yards.\\n\\nA few minutes\\' scouting proved this also to be unoccupied by those they\\nsought. At irregular intervals, around the sides, were several tunnels\\nsimilar to that from which the men had recently emerged.\\n\\nExchanging glances, the friends saw that each had begun to despair.\\nAfter this long and really arduous search, they seemed no nearer the\\nend than at first.\\n\\n\"Come,\" whispered Duplin, rousing himself, \"this is only wasting time,\\nwhen we should be at work. Cheer up--we must find him soon. I know we\\nwill--I feel it!\"\\n\\n\"I hope you are a true prophet,\" sighed Wythe, brushing the cold damp\\nfrom his forehead. \"But I fear the worst.\"\\n\\n\"Give me the light for awhile, and you take my place. We must search\\neach tunnel until we find the right one.\"\\n\\n\"I fear that will be difficult. I\\'ve not noticed any blood-drops for\\nsome time. What if we should be wrong? What will become of poor Jack?\\nAnd--_how are we to find our way back again_?\"\\n\\nDuplin started. For the first time he realized the full peril of their\\nsituation. Were they not even then lost? Lost in the labyrinth--in the\\nbowels of the earth! And nothing to sustain life--no food, no water!\\nThe thought was soul-sickening!\\n\\n\"We must not think of that _now_. We\\'ve enough to trouble our minds\\nwithout that. It may all turn out right. But mark the passage we came\\nthrough. With that to start from, we can find our way back by the\\nblood-stains. Drop my hat there--or a bit of rag, anything will do.\"\\n\\nWythe advanced a step, then paused and glanced around him. His face\\nshone ghastly pale in the feeble light of the tiny torch. It seemed\\nthat of a dead, rather than a living man.\\n\\n\"I--I _think_ this is the one,\" he faltered, pointing to a passage.\\n\\n\"My God! don\\'t you _know_? Then we are indeed lost!\" groaned Duplin,\\nthe cold sweat dripping from his brow.\\n\\n\"We have walked in every direction--I am bewildered. We can do nothing,\\nonly trust in Providence.\"\\n\\n\"And so we will! I don\\'t believe we are to perish in this manner. Cheer\\nup--\\'twill all turn out for the best,\" cried Duplin, rallying his\\ncourage.\\n\\n\"I\\'m willing enough to hope for the best, but these events follow close\\nafter that man\\'s warning of last night. There may have been more in it\\nthan we cared to admit.\"\\n\\n\"Come--no more o\\' that, Wythe. You only unnerve us both. Mark this\\ntunnel. We will first explore the one next upon its right--remember\\nthat. In time we must strike the right one.\"\\n\\nEntering the low-arched passage, Duplin led the way, holding the torch\\nso low that it fell full upon the floor. Leaving all other matters to\\nWythe, he closely and thoroughly scrutinized the passage in search of\\nthe blood-drops that had already guided their course so far.\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid we\\'re wrong, Burr,\" muttered Paley, after several minutes.\\n\"I can find no traces.\"\\n\\nHe had just rounded an acute corner in the passage, and thus cast Wythe\\nin the gloom. Stepping forward, Burr abruptly paused.\\n\\n\"My God! look yonder!\" he gasped rather than spoke, one hand extended\\nover Duplin\\'s shoulder.\\n\\nThe latter raised his eyes and then started back. Truly a horrible\\nsight was before them.\\n\\nA dull, ghastly light seemed to fill the space before them. A light\\nthat danced and flickered fitfully--now brilliant, now dull.\\n\\nThere, apparently almost within arm\\'s length of the two adventurers,\\nwere half a dozen flaming skeletons, not lying prone upon the floor,\\nbut seemingly just starting up from their recumbent position to\\nchastise the unhallowed disturbers of their last repose.\\n\\nFiery jets of flame seemed to dart forth from the eyeless sockets, from\\nthe grinning jaws, from every bone that helped form the skeletons,\\nand all with that peculiar effect produced by the plentiful use of\\nphosphorus.\\n\\nAs if turned to stone, the two friends stood at the turning, glaring\\nwildly upon the weird tableau.\\n\\nThen there echoed forth a startling sound, that seemed to proceed\\nfrom the glowing jaws of the blazing skeletons. A laugh, shrill and\\nunearthly, that echoed thrillingly through the long, narrow passage.\\n\\n\"My God! they move--they come!\" yelled Duplin, as he dropped the torch\\nand dashed madly back the way he had come, by some rare chance escaping\\na shattered skull, from collision with the numerous jagged points of\\nrock.\\n\\nWith that horrible laugh still ringing in their ears, Wythe followed\\nafter, half-dead with terror. Gasping, nearly suffocated by the wild\\nthrobbings of his heart, Duplin gained the chamber, and then sunk down\\nweak and trembling. Though life depended upon the exertion, he could go\\nno further.\\n\\n\"Burr--where are you?\" he gasped, agitatedly.\\n\\n\"Here--thank God we are together!\" came the low reply, as Wythe crept\\nto his side. \"But the light--where is it?\"\\n\\n\"I dropped it--I was so astonished. But we can kindle another. I have\\nmatches and you have wood.\"\\n\\n\"I?--no, I must have lost it as I ran. I had two sticks when we\\nentered, but they are gone now,\" slowly returned Wythe.\\n\\nBoth remained silent. Each realized the full force of this new\\ncalamity. Without a light how could they ever hope to find their\\nway out of this labyrinth? With a light, the task would be hard\\nenough--without one, it become simply impossible.\\n\\n\"We must regain them, even though we have to face that horrible sight\\nonce more,\" muttered Duplin, with a resolution that was simply\\nsublime, when his superstitious nature is remembered.\\n\\n\"Did _you_ hear it, too?\"\\n\\n\"The laughter--yes. It was no delusion. Pray God that I may never hear\\nit again!\"\\n\\n\"Hark!\"\\n\\nA low, indistinct sound met their ears. It seemed to proceed from the\\npassage they had just left. Its precise nature they could not define,\\nbut--perhaps the thought was excited by what had just occurred--they\\nfancied it was the faint echo of that horrible peal of laughter.\\n\\n\"It\\'s coming nearer--what shall we do?\" gasped Duplin, tremblingly.\\n\\n\"Remember what Jack showed us. There is some trickery here, I feel\\nsure. If we flee blindly through these passages, we are indeed lost.\\nWe must meet what is coming. If really supernatural, we can not run\\naway from it. If human, we can solve the mystery with a pistol-bullet,\"\\nhurriedly muttered Burr, as his revolver clicked sharply.\\n\\nHis resolution seemed to restore Duplin, and then, in silence they\\nawaited the result, though in painful suspense, for neither was free\\nfrom a sickening dread. Few men are equally brave in the dark and light.\\n\\nThe suspense was not of long duration. Another shrill, unearthly peal\\nof laughter rung through the rocky chamber, and then, as if by magic, a\\nglowing skeleton with every bone plainly outlined, stood before the two\\ngold-hunters.\\n\\nDuplin hastily cocked his revolver. It seemed that the sharp metallic\\n_click_ was not unheard, for another laugh, low and taunting, came\\nfrom where the ghastly object stood. Then a voice--the same that had\\naddressed them at their camp, the preceding night--uttered the words:\\n\\n\"Poor silly fools! Do ye think to alarm the dead by such actions?\\nWhat care I for mortal weapons? You but precipitate your fate by such\\nrashness. You scorned my first warning--and now you see the results.\\nOne of your number is dead--you two are doomed! Doomed to wander on\\nthrough the bowels of the earth unceasingly, until death takes pity\\nupon your sufferings and touches your hearts with his finger of ice.\\nYou were warned--why did you throw the chance behind you? You sealed\\nyour own fate. You are doomed--doomed! Ha! ha!\" and again the chilling\\npeal rung forth.\\n\\nAnd yet, strange as it may seem, these words gave Burr Wythe renewed\\ncourage. Though a partial believer in spiritualism, he did not believe\\nthat disembodied spirits could speak.\\n\\nThe owner of this same voice had, at the camp, left a substantial proof\\nbehind it that scarcely befitted a ghost. And now _this_ voice admitted\\nthe identity.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis some trick, Paley,\" he whispered in Duplin\\'s ear.\\n\\n\"Fire when I do, and we will have the clue in our hands. For poor\\nJack\\'s sake, courage.\"\\n\\n\"I will--touch me when you are ready,\" came the low, cautious response.\\n\\n\"_Now!_\"\\n\\nAs he shouted aloud this word Wythe fired, and almost simultaneously\\nDuplin\\'s pistol spoke. And the effect exceeded their most sanguine\\nexpectations.\\n\\nHigh above the twin reports, there rose a human voice in a wild yell of\\npain, then came a rattling crash--then the sound of heavy, repressed\\nfootsteps.\\n\\nInstantly, on firing, Duplin and Wythe sprung aside, and recocked their\\npistols. But there was no need of a second shot. The victory was theirs.\\n\\nThe glowing skeleton lay upon the ground, shattered to pieces. The\\nskull, like a great ball of fire, was slowly rolling toward Wythe, who\\neyed it with a shudder of loathing. But all else was motionless and\\nstill. The fleeing footsteps that had momentarily caught their ear, was\\nnow gone.\\n\\n\"Our spirit was Jack\\'s trickster, after all,\" at length uttered Wythe.\\n\\n\"We were fools, Burr,\" laughed Duplin, his natural courage returning.\\n\"It\\'s a lesson that will never be forgotten by us; and it was one that\\nI needed, too. I\\'m becoming a slave to my superstitions. But did you\\nnotice which way he went?\"\\n\\n\"No. Still, with lights, we can find out, I guess. That cry was one of\\npain. He must have been wounded.\"\\n\\n\"He was; perhaps mortally, though I hope not, for that might lose\\nus our hopes of finding Jack. But, come; we must find our torches.\\nThere is no time to lose unless we wish to make good that rascal\\'s\\nprediction, and die in here of thirst and starvation. This is the\\npassage--just behind these bones.\"\\n\\nCarefully feeling along the passage, they soon succeeded in finding\\nthe dried fagots, dropped when they took a hasty flight. One--the\\ntorch--was still smoldering, and required but little coaxing before it\\nagain blazed up.\\n\\nBy its light, the two friends exchanged glances. They were both\\nthinking of the same thing.\\n\\n\"Yes, we will examine them,\" exclaimed Duplin, resolutely advancing.\\n\"Who knows--we may find some trace of _him_ there.\"\\n\\nWith far different sensations than those felt when first the weird\\nsight burst upon their vision, the gold-hunters now examined the row of\\nskeletons. They lay side by side, upon a sloping ledge, which, in the\\nfirst affright, gave them the appearance of raising to their feet. The\\nfriends saw that at least two of the skeletons had been removed from\\nthe ghastly row.\\n\\n\"They have been placed here with care,\" muttered Wythe. \"See--here are\\nfragments of what was once cloth. The bones look as though covered with\\nskin--as though the flesh had gradually dried away, and the sinews\\nstill hold together. That accounts for the perfect skeletons we saw\\narranged by that rascal--whoever he is.\"\\n\\n\"This dry, rare air may account for that. But we must not forget the\\nduty we owe poor Jack. He is not here.\"\\n\\n\"Come, then. We can follow our mummer, if I mistake not. I think he\\'ll\\nleave a plain trail behind him, if there\\'s any virtue in half-ounce\\nbullets.\"\\n\\nIn a few moments the adventurers were once more in the chamber, and\\nexamining the ground round about where the skeleton had fallen. True to\\ntheir hopes, they found several drops of blood that told plainly their\\nenemy was wounded.\\n\\n\"This is the passage,\" uttered Duplin. \"But it seems to lead back the\\nsame way we came.\"\\n\\n\"We are all turned round. It _may_, of course, but more likely it\\ncontinues in the direction we first started in. It is our only chance,\\nat any rate.\"\\n\\nFor half an hour more they crept on, slowly and carefully, knowing that\\nto go astray might result in their destruction. Several branch passages\\nwere observed, but close scouting showed them the faint blood-traces,\\nthat directed them aright.\\n\\nBut then a circumstance occurred that threatened them with disaster.\\nThe second torch had burned nearly down to Wythe\\'s fingers, and he\\npaused to light another. Unfortunately he dropped the splinter, and\\nfalling, it became extinguished. Blow as he might the sparks refused to\\nblaze up.\\n\\nImpatiently he asked Duplin for a match. To his horror, Paley answered\\nthat he had none! Whether he had lost them during the flight or not,\\nit was certain that they were then in the labyrinth, without means to\\nkindle a light. Search as they might, not a match was found.\\n\\nAs the significant truth burst upon them in its full force, they seemed\\nlike madmen. They raved and cursed until out of breath. Then reason\\nreturned. They were only wasting precious strength that might yet be\\nneeded to save them from a horrible death.\\n\\n\"Come, Duplin,\" hoarsely muttered Wythe, \"we must be men. We need our\\nsenses now, if ever. We _must_ find some way out of this. Come--creep\\nforward with me. Try to keep this passage. Perhaps we may succeed--it\\nis our only hope.\"\\n\\n\"A slim one,\" and Duplin smothered back a curse. \"I begin to believe\\nthat that prediction will come true--that this hole is our _grave_!\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t give way to such thoughts. Hope while we may. The worst, if it\\n_must_ come, will come soon enough.\"\\n\\nFor an hour--a long, weary hour full of agonizing fears and doubts--the\\ncomrades crept slowly on, upon their hands and knees, not knowing\\nwhether they were nearing or distancing safety. But then Burr Wythe,\\nwho was in advance, gave way to a gasping cry--a cry of joyful\\nthanksgiving.\\n\\n\"Thank God! we are saved! This is the first chamber--I can tell it!\"\\n\\n\"But--\" hesitated Duplin, \"then we should see the light. _Where is the\\nhole we crept in at?_\"\\n\\nAll before them was dark and black. They could see nothing. And now\\nWythe remembered that as they first entered the tunnel, he had glanced\\nback. The hole then shone clear and distinct. It was gone now!\\n\\nWith a cry of apprehension he arose and sprung forward. In a moment he\\ndiscovered the truth.\\n\\nThis was indeed the outer chamber. And he felt where the entrance had\\nbeen. _It was now blocked up!_\\n\\n_They were buried alive!_\\n\\nBoth sunk to the ground, heart-sick and despairing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER VII.\\n\\n                          NATE UPSHUR\\'S WORK.\\n\\n\\nOn the night of the storm, Nathan Upshur sat apart from his two\\ncomrades, noiselessly smoking his pipe. That he was not in the best of\\nhumor was plainly evident.\\n\\nIt was only several hours since they had come on the whereabouts of\\nWythe and his companions, after an arduous search of several days\\'\\nduration. But yet, short as was the time, Upshur had proposed a\\nbloody plan to Chicot and Dooley--nothing less than murdering the\\ngold-hunters, and then taking their treasure.\\n\\nHis ill-humor now was caused by their flat refusal to enter into\\nany thing of the sort. They had counted the cost, and were willing\\nto enforce their rights to a portion of the placer, if need be,\\nby an appeal to arms, but it must be in open fight, not midnight\\nassassination. But Upshur objected to this. It savored too much of\\npersonal danger, and that he did not greatly fancy. So he sat brooding\\nover the matter, sour and sullen.\\n\\n\"It\\'s jest this,\" quoth Chicot, settling the ashes in his pipe. \"They\\n_must_ let us in on shar\\'s. I\\'ll tell \\'em that I knew of it fust--last\\nyear, an\\' that I on\\'y j\\'ined the train so\\'s to git to the place. They\\ncain\\'t deny it--or, ef they do, they cain\\'t prove that I lie. _Then_ ef\\nthey cut up rusty, let \\'em. We kin make \\'em sick o\\' the job, I reckon.\\nBut I won\\'t hev no onderhand work--no rubbin\\' out in the dark--mind\\n_that_, Nate Upshur.\"\\n\\nThey were encamped upon the hillside, in a deep crevice in the rocks\\nthat overhung their heads, where the tiny camp-fire was hidden from any\\none unless within a half-score yards of the spot. And, as he stated his\\nposition, Paul Chicot lay down to sleep, unmindful of the coming storm.\\n\\nBut that night was not to pass without disturbance, even with them.\\nSuddenly the clear report of fire-arms broke upon the air, coming, as\\nall knew, from the gold-hunters\\' camp.\\n\\nPeering over the rocks, they saw a strange, luminous light moving above\\nthe valley, but before they could guess its meaning, the light suddenly\\nvanished. While still gazing down, they heard a rapid footfall just\\nabove them, and then a strangely-shaped, dark figure bounded past them,\\nup the rocks. It seemed the form of a man, bearing an unwieldy bundle\\nupon his shoulder, dark, and dimly-outlined.\\n\\nLittle slumber visited their eyes that night, and his curiosity\\nexcited, Chicot plunged through the storm on a reconnoitering\\nexpedition. He soon returned, saying that the three gold-hunters were\\nstill in their shanty.\\n\\nThen who or what was the dark figure? Were there still other parties in\\nthe valley? Others after the golden hoard that lay beneath the sands?\\n\\nAwaiting other developments, Chicot and his companions, early in the\\nmorning, saw the three friends start forth as if with some definite\\npurpose in view. They hastily passed over the rocky ridge, unconscious\\nof the eyes that so closely watched them.\\n\\n\"Now\\'s our time,\" eagerly muttered Upshur. \"We can go and dig up their\\ngold and be off before they get back.\"\\n\\n\"Not yet,\" firmly replied Chicot, who seemed to possess a little more\\nconscience than his comrades. \"We don\\'t know how soon they may be back,\\nand I don\\'t want to be caught stealin\\', jest yet. Le\\'s watch and see\\nwhat they\\'re about, fust.\"\\n\\nGrumblingly Upshur submitted, and the trio crept up to the ridge, and\\npeered over it, keeping well screened. From there they saw the others\\ndiscover the double trail and closely examine it. Then separating,\\nDuplin and Wythe took one course, Jack Tyrrel the other.\\n\\n\"They\\'re trailin\\' the critter we see\\'d, most likely,\" muttered Chicot.\\n\"Le\\'s watch until they git out o\\' sight, then we\\'ll go fer the gold.\"\\n\\nImpatiently they watched the tardy progress of the adventurers, for now\\nthat a chance seemed open for them to effect their object, they were\\none and all eager to handle the gold. From their position the valley\\nbelow them was visible for nearly a mile in either direction, bare and\\ntreeless, desolate and dreary-looking.\\n\\n\"My eyes hain\\'t as good as they war once, but, onless I\\'m mightily\\nmistook, they\\'s trouble waitin\\' fer Jack, over yon\\'. I\\'m \\'most sure\\nI sighted a human on them rocks. But it\\'s gone, now. This\\'s gittin\\'\\ninterestin\\'--seems like we\\'re goin\\' to hev two separate gangs to deal\\nwith.\"\\n\\nWith curiosity fully aroused, the trio watched Tyrrel\\'s progress, and\\nas he passed round the point of rocks indicated by Chicot, the watchers\\nfairly held their breath with suspense.\\n\\nThen came the sounds that had so deeply alarmed Duplin and Wythe--two\\nquickly-succeeding pistol-shots, then a cry for help.\\n\\n\"I told ye so,\" muttered Chicot, excitedly. \"Tyrrel\\'s in trouble \\'th\\n_some_thin\\'! Down--quick! See, thar comes t\\'other fellers. Ef they\\nsight us, it\\'s fight, then, shore. They\\'d think _we_ was at the bottom\\no\\' the deviltry. Hunker down, I say!\"\\n\\n\"Now\\'s our chance to get hold o\\' the gold,\" muttered Nate Upshur,\\neagerly. \"We\\'ll have time.\"\\n\\n\"No--I\\'m goin\\' to see this a\\'fa\\'r out fust. It\\'s best that we know jest\\nwhat an\\' who we\\'ve got to work ag\\'in\\', an\\' we\\'ll never hev a better\\nchaince to find out. Come--keep along behind the ridge. We kin git up\\nopposite the spot where Jack was, afore t\\'others. Keerful--don\\'t show\\nyour head \\'bove the ridge.\"\\n\\nThough having the longest and by far the roughest road, Chicot and his\\ncompanions gained the desired point ahead of Duplin and Wythe, owing to\\nthe latter having to follow Tyrrel\\'s trail. But, though they closely\\nscrutinized the opposite ridge, nothing in human form was to be seen.\\n\\n\"The boy\\'s gone, an\\' so\\'s whoever he run ag\\'inst. Mebbe he\\'s rubbed\\nout, an\\' the fellers is layin\\' fer t\\'others.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll soon see, for there comes Duplin and Wythe,\" added Upshur.\\n\\nIn silence the trio watched and waited. Every movement of the two\\ncomrades was noted. What they were the reader already knows.\\n\\nFor a time the watchers were puzzled, but then as the two men began\\ngathering dried sticks from under the sheltered rocks, the truth\\ngradually became plain. Paul Chicot gave vent to a long, low whistle.\\n\\n\"They\\'ve holed the game!\"\\n\\n\"Surely the fools ain\\'t going to venture in?\"\\n\\n\"It _is_ foolish, but they show plenty o\\' grit. You see now what you\\nwanted to buck ag\\'inst.\"\\n\\n\"If they go in there, the game\\'s in our hands!\" exultantly muttered\\nUpshur, his eyes glowing wickedly.\\n\\n\"What d\\'y\\' mean by that?\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t we _block them in_? Then they\\'ll have a good chance to fight it\\nout with those they are hunting, while we can take our time about the\\ngold. In that way we get rid ef them without killing them, and just as\\neffectually too.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see much difference, if ye l\\'ave them there to starve,\" slowly\\ncommented Tim Dooley, for the first time for hours giving his opinion,\\nin this respect being very different from the popular idea of an\\nIrishman.\\n\\n\"If you\\'re so cursed tender-hearted, why don\\'t you go an offer to help\\n_them_? Had I known what a milksop you were I\\'d never have lifted a\\nfinger to help you to a fortune.\"\\n\\n\"Nor would ye, only ye wanted help. But best kape a bridle on yer\\ntongue, my fri\\'nd. I don\\'t take black words from anybody,\" quietly\\nadded Dooley.\\n\\n\"Dry up--quit yer quarrelin\\'. Whar\\'s the use? It don\\'t do no good, an\\'\\nonly makes bad blood. We\\'re workin\\' in harness now, an\\' each must keep\\nup his eend. Fust work--then pleasure. Fight then as much as ye please.\\nBut I think that\\'s a good idea o\\' your\\'n, Upshur. We kin block \\'em in,\\ns\\'posin\\' they give us a chaince, an\\' then, when we\\'re ready to travel,\\nwe kin set \\'em free. But mind ye, this we\\'ve got to do. I won\\'t take a\\nstep in the matter onless this is all onderstood.\"\\n\\n\"Nayther will I.\"\\n\\n\"Just as you like about that,\" impatiently added Upshur. \"But we\\'re\\nlosing valuable time. That may be but a small den, and we be too late.\\nThen if they see us, it _must_ come to blows.\"\\n\\n\"Ef they begin, why we\\'ll give \\'em the best we\\'ve got, in course. Come,\\nthen, le\\'s travel.\"\\n\\nDescending the ridge, the three men ran hastily across the level\\nvalley, and soon gained the second hill. As the reader knows, this\\ndanger was not suspected by either Duplin or Wythe.\\n\\n\"You and Tim see if you can roll over that big rock above there,\"\\nmuttered Upshur, kneeling down beside a bowlder. \"I\\'ll agree that they\\nshall not disturb your work, if they hear you too soon. I can keep them\\nback, I guess.\"\\n\\nAt that moment, as he covered the entrance to the cave with a revolver\\nin either hand, cocked and ready, Nathan Upshur ardently hoped that\\nthe two men he hated with such venomous animosity would appear. A good\\nshot, he felt that the path before him would soon be cleared, and the\\nstain of the midnight murder fairly fixed upon the innocent Burr Wythe.\\n\\nExerting their strength to the utmost, the two men at length succeeded\\nin toppling over the bowlder, that must have weighed many tons. Had it\\nnot been so nicely poised, their efforts would have been in vain.\\n\\nAs the huge mass settled fairly over the hole, Nate Upshur laughed\\naloud in diabolical glee. He knew that mortal hands could not remove\\nthe rock, without the aid of strong tools. In the excitement of the\\nmoment, neither Chicot nor Dooley had thought of this, and they now\\nfelt a pang of regret. It seemed as though they had been committing a\\ncowardly murder.\\n\\n\"That\\'s one job done--and well done, too, I call it,\" and Upshur\\nchuckled. \"Now for the other. We alone are the owners of this famous\\ngolden bed that Duplin raved about. Come--I am in haste to know the\\nextent of our fortune. Don\\'t look so grum--you should laugh instead,\\nman.\"\\n\\n\"I feel like a dog that\\'s caught sheep-killin\\', or aig-suckin\\',\"\\nmuttered Chicot. \"We\\'ve mebbe rubbed out two settlers as is a durned\\nsight better men than either o\\' us, in a cowardly way, too.\"\\n\\n\"Bah! I suppose you\\'ll be too conscientious to touch any of the gold\\nthey\\'ve dug, won\\'t you?\" sneered Upshur.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know--if they _be_ gone, why I s\\'pose I might as well hev some\\no\\' what they left, as for _you_ to git it all.\"\\n\\n\"I thought so! But come--the sooner we finish this job, the better.\\nThere _may_ be another outlet to the cave, and these fools may stumble\\nupon it, and come back in time to make us trouble. But once let us get\\nclutches on their pile, and I think we can hold it.\"\\n\\nWith hasty steps, the three men recrossed the little valley, and\\nfrom the other ridge, carefully reconnoitered the deserted camp. No\\none appeared to be near it, and their hearts thrilled wildly as they\\nrealized that they were now sole masters of the golden secret. Even\\nChicot forgot his scruples, in the dream of fabulous wealth that filled\\nhis mind.\\n\\n\"It\\'s ours--all ours, now!\" muttered Upshur, as he darted down the\\nrough hillside at reckless speed, slowly followed by his comrades.\\n\\nIn a few minutes more they stood within the rude brush shanty. Eagerly\\nthey gazed around, as though expecting to discover great heaps of the\\nprecious metal. Then Upshur laughed--harshly and discordantly.\\n\\n\"Bah! what fools! Of course they\\'ve hid it. But what one hides, another\\ncan find. They\\'ve changed the gold to another place--for there\\'s where\\nit has been.\"\\n\\nAll could see as much, but the gold was not there. Still, it must be\\nhidden near at hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\\n\\n                          THE WILD-MAN AGAIN.\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, where was Jack Tyrrel?\\n\\nWe left him at the moment when he turned round the point of rocks,\\nfollowing on the strange trail. A few rods beyond this, and he suddenly\\npaused as a peculiar cry met his ear.\\n\\nHastily glancing up, a strange light met his gaze. A flash of\\nrecognition lit up his face. He had seen that form once before.\\n\\nIt was, indeed, none other than the occupant of the hill-cave, whom he\\nhad beheld fed like a child by the beautiful maiden; the one whom he\\nhad, a few hours later, seen shot at by Nate Upshur. The being called\\nby Paul Chicot, the \"Mountain Devil.\"\\n\\nHe stood at the base of a large bowlder, one hand outstretched,\\nclutching his long bow already spoken of. His attitude, his face, his\\neyes, all told that he was angered.\\n\\n\"Back! rash fool!\" he uttered in a deep, stern tone. \"I warned you\\nonce--this is sacred ground. Back, I say, or you die!\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be so headstrong, old man,\" coolly returned Jack, seating\\nhimself upon a bowlder. \"You have nothing to fear from us. When we\\nfinish our work, we intend leaving--and allow me to add that you nor\\nany one else can make us stir one step before we get ready.\"\\n\\nThe wild-man--or madman, whichever he was, and both titles well suited\\nhim--uttered another hoarse, inarticulate cry, and, with lightning-like\\nquickness, fitted an arrow to the string. Jack sprung to his feet, but\\nwas too late to avoid the shaft.\\n\\nIt struck him fairly, pinioning his right arm to his side, the flinty\\nhead plunging deep into the muscles of his side and back. Stung with\\npain, and scarcely realizing the extent of his injuries, Jack drew a\\nrevolver with his left hand, and fired twice, in succession, at the\\nsame time uttering a half-unconscious cry for help.\\n\\nThen the madman was upon him. With a giant\\'s strength he dashed\\nthe young man backward to the ground, and wresting the pistol from\\nhis grasp, he dealt Tyrrel a stunning blow upon the head with its\\nbrass-bound butt.\\n\\nWith a low moan, Jack lost all consciousness. The events of the next\\nfew hours were a blank to him.\\n\\nProbably urged on by some strange whim, the madman flung the senseless\\nbody across his shoulder and then darted back to the cave entrance,\\nthrough which he plunged. As though gifted with cat-like eyes, he ran\\nswiftly on through the winding passages, never once seemingly at fault,\\nthe only trace left being the drops of blood that fell from Tyrrel\\'s\\nwounds.\\n\\nWhen, at length, Tyrrel regained his senses, he first became conscious\\nof a gentle hand softly bathing his feverish and painfully throbbing\\ntemples. With an effort he opened his eyes and gazed wildly around him,\\nbewildered, confused.\\n\\nBut then, as a pale, sweet face bent over him, anxiety written in every\\nfeature, a wondering sigh broke from his lips. He recognized that\\nface--it had more than once come up before him since that first night\\npassed in the mountains after the desertion.\\n\\nThe same glance recalled the place he was in; the hole in the wall\\nwhere he had first looked upon the face of the madman. But how came he\\nhere? Could it be that the madman had relented, bringing him here to be\\nnursed back to life and health by his own daughter?\\n\\nThese thoughts racked his mind, and must have left their imprint upon\\nhis face, for the woman--or girl, rather, for she was not more, in\\nyears, at least--gently pressed back his head, uttering in a low, soft\\nvoice:\\n\\n\"You must not trouble your brain now, sir. All will be explained in\\ngood time. Until then, rest easy. You are safe here, while I am near.\"\\n\\n\"But where am I?--and you--\"\\n\\n\"Listen. You are still in danger, unless you are prudent. Drink this,\\nand then go to sleep. When you waken, I will tell you all that I know\\nof this affair,\" and she uttered a weary sigh, as she spoke.\\n\\n\"I will mind--you look like an angel,\" muttered Jack, his heavy lids\\ndrooping as he sunk back after quaffing the drink. \"I\\'ve thought so\\never since--that night. And I--I love--you!\" The last word being\\nscarcely distinguishable, as he dropped asleep.\\n\\nThe maiden looked astonished, as well she might, since until a few\\nhours before, she had never once suspected the existence of such a\\npersonage as Jack Tyrrel.\\n\\nIt was hours before Jack awoke, but then he felt much better, though\\nstill very weak and faint from much loss of blood. His brain, though\\nlight, did not throb, his flesh was cool and moist.\\n\\nHe was not long in reminding his fair nurse of her promise, and in a\\nfew clear sentences she told him all she knew concerning the matter.\\n\\nHer father--the madman, for such indeed he was--had returned from\\none of his frequent excursions, bearing the senseless body upon his\\nshoulder, both covered with blood. She could gather nothing from his\\nincoherent ravings, save that he intended offering up his victim as\\na sacrifice to some imaginary deity. Great as was her influence over\\nhim, even in his wildest moods it was with absolute danger to herself\\nthat she rescued Jack from his hands. Then, however, he soon calmed\\ndown, and watched her dress Tyrrel\\'s wounds with vacant curiosity. This\\ndone, she discovered that her father also was wounded; a deep hurt,\\nevidently from a bullet, passing entirely through the left shoulder.\\nScarcely waiting for this to be dressed, he left the cave, muttering\\nwild threats against some person or persons. That was in the early part\\nof the night; it was now broad day, and she was very uneasy concerning\\nhim.\\n\\nSuch, in substance, was her explanation. In return, Jack briefly\\nsketched the events of the past few days.\\n\\n\"And now, lady--\"\\n\\n\"Lucy is my name,\" she simply added.\\n\\n\"Thank you--and mine is Jack Tyrrel. But I was wondering--naturally,\\ntoo, as you must admit--how it happens that you are here, living in\\nsuch a place.\"\\n\\n\"I will tell you; it will help pass away the time, and any thing is\\nbetter than silence. Such terrible fears come over me at times, that I\\noften wonder if I am not going mad--but I must not think of that. Do\\nyou know, sir, that until now, for over a year, I have not looked upon\\na human face, excepting father\\'s?\"\\n\\nJack squeezed her hand sympathetically. Lucy shrunk back as if alarmed,\\nbut then, blushing deeply, she hastily added:\\n\\n\"Well, I will tell you my story. It is a strange one, and often I\\nhalf-wonder if I am not dreaming--if all the black, horrible past is\\nnot a dream, from which I shall awake some bright day.\\n\\n\"As I said, my name is Lucy--Lucy Bradford, and the man who brought you\\nhere is my father. He was not always thus--his madness dates back to a\\nyear or more ago.\\n\\n\"Father was ever peculiar, and after mother\\'s death--which occurred\\nwhen I was quite a child--he became still more so, and I can now\\nunderstand the covert hints and strange bits of talk that used to\\npuzzle me, passing between the neighbors. They believed he was\\ngradually losing his mind.\\n\\n\"It was a queer but very pleasant life that I led, as I began to\\nunderstand things that I saw around me. Father was an actor--as I\\nbelieved then, the prince of actors--but the plain, almost miserable\\nstyle in which we were forced to exist, should have showed me better.\\nIt was one constant, unceasing struggle for bread, and yet we were very\\nhappy.\\n\\n\"Father loved his art, and was only fully happy when \\'treading the\\nboards.\\' And he was sure of an appreciative house, behind the scenes,\\nfor I would applaud until my poor hands were nearly blistered. I\\nhalf-fear that it was this that made father love me so dearly.\\n\\n\"I attended each rehearsal with him, and was never absent from my post\\nin the flies when he was on the stage. This became such a matter of\\ncourse that no attention was paid me by the other actors.\\n\\n\"Well, times changed. Father became so \\'queer\\'--that is what the\\nstage-manager called it--that he could not be depended upon. More than\\nonce I remember his marring the effect of a play by forgetting himself,\\nand delivering the \\'mad speech\\' of King Lear. He was discharged, and\\ncould not get another situation.\\n\\n\"One day, I remember, he came home greatly excited, hastily packed up\\nall his stage effects and then left the house without answering my\\nquestions. He returned with money, having sold all. Then he told me of\\nthe dazzling plan that he had in view. He was going to California, to\\npick up a fortune from the countless heaps of golden treasure that lay\\nthere.\\n\\n\"Well, I could not desert him. That was in \\'49--over a year ago. Father\\nhad money enough to pay for our passage out, and leaving St. Louis, we\\nturned our faces toward the Land of Gold. Alas! not one of all that\\ntrain--men, women, children--not one of them all ever reached the land\\nof their hopes.\\n\\n\"I do not know whether the story of our disaster ever reached\\ncivilization or not. If so, it must have been by accident, for\\nwe--father and I--alone, of all that company, are now alive!\\n\\n\"One wild, stormy night the blow fell. The day past had been one of\\nunusually severe toil, and most probably the guards set to watch over\\nthe safety of their friends and kindred, completely exhausted, yielded\\nto slumber. For the cunning, treacherous enemy crept, unheard and\\nunsuspected, into the very heart of our camp. And then--\"\\n\\nShuddering, Lucy paused, bowing her head upon her hands. The scene\\nrecalled by her story overpowered her.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t say any more, Lucy, if it is so hard,\" whispered Jack, his hand\\ngently touching the bowed head.\\n\\n\"Perhaps I am foolishly sensitive,\" Lucy added, with a wan smile, as\\nshe raised her head. \"But at times that horrible scene comes before my\\neyes until it seems that my brain must burst. It is a relief to speak\\nof it, though, to one who can understand.\\n\\n\"I can remember but little of that horrible night. The Indians attacked\\nus--Blackfeet, as I afterward learned. They conquered almost without a\\nblow being struck by the white men, so complete was the surprise. And\\nthen--it was a merciless massacre.\\n\\n\"I remember wondering how long it would be before my time would come.\\nI had been awakened, but was still in our own tent. Father lay at my\\nfeet, as I believed, still sleeping, though I wondered greatly that\\nthe horrible din did not waken him. I know now that he was senseless,\\nstricken down by a brutal blow from the hand of the one who guarded me.\\n\\n\"This man was the one who had acted as our guide, a middle aged, rough,\\nhunter-like person. He had joined the train with the sole purpose of\\nluring it to destruction. How well he succeeded, you now know.\\n\\n\"It was a long time before I fairly regained my senses. For nearly a\\nmonth I had been like a maniac, and the Indians had protected me from\\nthe malice of the renegade. This superstition alone saved my father. We\\nwere regarded as sacred beings.\\n\\n\"But then, when my reason returned, I was again subject to the\\npersecution of the renegade--Creeping Snake, as the Indians called him.\\nI appealed to the chief, who could both speak and understand English,\\nthough but imperfectly, for protection against the wretch. I believe\\nthat he pitied me, but he dared not interfere. By the laws of the\\ntribe, I belonged wholly to the renegade.\\n\\n\"The end came sooner than I expected. One day the renegade came to the\\nlodge that had been given father and I, and one glance at his flushed\\nface and bloodshot eyes told me my peril. He was intoxicated, and his\\nworst passions were fully aroused.\\n\\n\"I shrunk behind father in fear and trembling. The renegade advanced,\\nwith a horrible curse, and struck father, ordering him to stand aside.\\nYou have seen him--you know how very strong he is; and then he was\\ninsane.\\n\\n\"It was all over in a breath, almost. A brief, horrible struggle--then\\nthe renegade lay upon the lodge floor, quivering, dead! The blood was\\nstreaming from his mouth and nostrils. His neck was broken.\\n\\n\"The chief had witnessed it all, but had not time to interfere, before\\nall was over. He seemed frightfully angered and had I not clung to his\\nknees, pleading piteously, I believe he would have killed father. As it\\nwas, he had time to reflect that a madman was not accountable for his\\nacts.\\n\\n\"A council was held, and father tried for the deed. But the fact of his\\nmadness saved him. And yet he seemed to realize that he was in danger,\\nthough he hid his feelings from all save me.\\n\\n\"That night--a dark and stormy one--we left the village, passing\\nthrough it undiscovered. By daylight we were far away, lost amidst the\\nwild mountains. The beating rain had obliterated our tracks, and if the\\nIndians sought for us it was without success.\\n\\n\"For days we lay hid during the day, traveling at night, trying to find\\nsome way to civilization, but in vain. We nearly starved to death. But\\nby a chance--or rather providence--father killed a wounded antelope\\nthat we found in a deep valley. On this we lived for several days.\\n\\n\"Father seemed to have forgotten his desire to reach his fellow-men,\\nand appeared contented with this wild life. We were living in a little\\nden or cave in the rocks; not this one--but another miles away.\\n\\n\"One night we were awakened by a muttering at the cave entrance.\\nOutlined against the clear sky, we could distinguish the plumed crest\\nof a savage. Probably he had observed us before night, and now had come\\nto kill us.\\n\\n\"I was petrified with fear, but not so father. I did not know he was\\nawake, until I heard him move suddenly. Then came a dull, heavy thud,\\nand the Indian\\'s head disappeared, while a shrill yell of what seemed\\nmortal agony followed.\\n\\n\"I soon learned the truth. Father, with unerring aim, had flung a\\nheavy, jagged rock at the intruder. As I saw when day came, the blow\\nhad shattered his skull to atoms. That was a long, dreary night of\\nterror, but the savage must have been alone, for no further disturbance\\noccurred.\\n\\n\"In this manner father became armed as you have seen him, with bow and\\narrows, a knife and tomahawk. By long practice, he has become very\\nskillful with the bow, and we never want for food. As for clothing,\\nas you see, their skins furnish that. Though rude, they are very\\ncomfortable.\\n\\n\"With that one exception, we have never been molested by the savages.\\nDuring one of his wild rambles father found this cave, and ever since\\nwe have lived here.\"\\n\\n\"A strange story, Lucy, and a sad one,\" commented Jack, feelingly. \"But\\ndo you never long to return to civilization?\"\\n\\n\"Often--very often. But what can I do? Even though the road was open\\nto me--and I am lost here as completely as though out of the world--I\\ncould not desert father. You have seen him--do you think I would ever\\nreturn to life? He is mad--incurably so, I fear,\" gloomily responded\\nthe maiden.\\n\\n\"But if I can induce him to go with us, will you object? You will like\\nmy friends, Duplin and Burr. Think of what your fate would be were--in\\ncase any thing should happen to your father.\"\\n\\n\"I would die--perhaps starve to death. I try not to think of that. I\\nonly know that I can never desert _him_. I am all that he seems to care\\nfor on earth, now. While he lives, my place is with him.\"\\n\\n\"But if he agrees to go with us?\"\\n\\n\"Where he goes, I will go. But don\\'t think too much of that. I fear he\\nwill refuse.\"\\n\\n\"Hist! is that not the sound of some one climbing up the rocks?\"\\nhastily muttered Tyrrel, not a little excited, half-hoping that his\\nfriends had discovered his retreat.\\n\\n\"I will go see. Perhaps \\'tis father returning,\" and Lucy hastened to\\nthe entrance.\\n\\nIn a moment she returned, pale and agitated. Tyrrel felt a strange\\nfluttering at his heart, for he was unarmed. If an enemy, they were\\nindeed lost!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER IX.\\n\\n                          THE OUTLAW\\'S HOME.\\n\\n\\nBut what of the train wending its weary way among the hills, trying,\\nunder the guidance of Major Guilford, to follow the blind trail?\\n\\nAh, it is a query pregnant with sad events--with tears and sighs--with\\nacts that make human nature seem like demon-nature.\\n\\nFor here, in the outlaw\\'s lair, away up among the hills--in his secret\\ngrotto--we find--who?\\n\\nWhy, Lottie Mitchell!\\n\\nAnd consoling her in her terrible grief is Mabel, the professed\\ndaughter of Major Guilford, but now the acknowledged wife and emissary\\nof Yellow Jack!\\n\\nAnd outside we hear the voice of Major Guilford, and learn from\\nhis conversation, first, the fact that he is Yellow Jack\\'s\\nfirst-lieutenant; and second, the particulars of the slaughter of that\\nentire train, which, following his guidance, was led into an ambuscade,\\nand every soul in it ruthlessly slain by the outlaws, as they had\\ndestroyed and slain other trains. The diabolical glee which the affair\\nexcited in the outlaw camp revealed the nature of the ruffians with\\nwhom Guilford consorted.\\n\\nBut he had other matters also to discuss with some of the men. He had\\nrescued Lottie Mitchell and brought her safely into the outlaw camp\\nonly to see Yellow Jack take her under his immediate protection. Was he\\nto be deprived of his property? Was not Lottie his own by the laws of\\nthe band? And if so, by what right did the captain take her under his\\nprotection?\\n\\nThis the \"Major\" demanded in a manner that showed how bitterly he felt\\nover the event, and his openly announced purpose to have his prize\\nyet, gave little promise of peace or safety to the now distressed and\\nheart-broken captive, whose hours passed in weeping over the awful\\ntragedy which her eyes had witnessed, and whose fears for her own\\nfuture were even more harrowing than her grief.\\n\\nFor a time Lottie Mitchell was treated more as a guest than a prisoner\\nby Yellow Jack and his household. Even Mabel, though herself scarcely\\nso beautiful, strove to cheer up the sorrowing girl, even while a dull\\npain knocked at her own heart as she recognized the gradually changing\\nexpression with which the outlaw chief began to regard the fair captive.\\n\\nNone knew better than she that Yellow Jack was even more to be dreaded\\nthan Charles Guilford--that Lottie, in fleeing from the hawk, had\\nsought protection of the eagle.\\n\\nWith heart crushed and bowed down, Lottie would sit through the\\nlong hours in mute despair. She knew now that she was alone upon\\nearth--that not one drop of blood akin to her flowed in human veins.\\nHer loving father had been the last, and now he was no more. He was\\ndead--murdered! And she--oh! why had she been spared? To live on and\\nsuffer--to endure worse than death--a shameful captivity in the hands\\nof demons who had love for naught other than sin and crime.\\n\\nAnd yet, though knowing all this, Lottie believed that she was safe\\nfrom harm while Yellow Jack extended his protection. She knew that\\nMabel was his wife--that a fierce, passionate love seemed to exist\\nbetween them. Then--what had she to fear from him?\\n\\nThus she reasoned, but the mask was soon to fall from his face--the\\nscales from her eyes. The trial, though slow in coming, would lose none\\nof its force on that account.\\n\\nA brief \"scene\" had followed the unceremonious despoiling of Guilford.\\nHis fiery, untamed nature was not one to submit without a word;\\nbesides, he was backed up by the laws of the league, that distinctly\\nsaid a man possessed the sole power of life or death over any captive\\nhe might chance to take unaided.\\n\\nGuilford waited until the entire band had returned. Then he called them\\naround him in the little square of unoccupied ground near the center\\nof the village. His undaunted bravery and boldness had made him very\\npopular among the outlaws.\\n\\nIn hot, angry words he told them how he had been treated and how the\\nlaws of the league had been trampled upon without cause or provocation.\\nHe demanded their vote--whether the captive rightly belonged to him, or\\nto Yellow Jack.\\n\\nThe outlaws seemed about to reply--to give the words utterance that\\nwould please the orator--when a clear, metallic voice silenced them.\\nThe outlaws, bold and desperate men though they were, seemed awed and\\nshrunk silently back, parting before the approach of that one slender,\\nfrail-looking man, who so negligently puffed at a tiny cigarette.\\n\\n\"Pardon, gentlemen,\" he uttered, the words dropping with cat-like\\nsoftness from his red lips, that curled in a smile at once sweet\\nand cruel. \"Hearing my name mentioned, I come to plead my own case.\\nGuilford, what is your grievance?\"\\n\\n\"That you took by force from me a captive. By the laws of the league\\nyou had no right to do this. She is mine alone--I demand her return.\"\\n\\nThe words were spoken boldly and without hesitation. Yet the manner in\\nwhich the flushed face suddenly turned white, told that Guilford by\\nno means underrated his danger. It was like playing with a half-tamed\\ntiger. At first its talons might be sheathed--but who could say how\\nlong this would last?\\n\\n\"So you consider yourself an abused man, do you?\" slowly drawled Yellow\\nJack.\\n\\n\"I deem my rights as a member of the band, abridged. By the laws laid\\ndown by yourself, you are wronging me in taking away my property.\"\\n\\n\"And if I return her--this property of yours--you will overlook my\\nmistake?\"\\n\\n\"Gladly!\" cried Guilford, too excited by the pleasing thought thus\\npresented to read aright the sneering tone and the yellowish glitter of\\nthe black eyes.\\n\\n\"You are very kind. But I fear both my wife and your property would\\nobject. Besides, I\\'ve taken a notion to her myself. And captain before\\nlieutenant, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Then you refuse to--\"\\n\\n\"Bah! why so much to-do about a trifle? you grow tiresome, Guilford.\\nWe will have to select another officer from the ranks.\"\\n\\nAt this sentence--the last--Yellow Jack gave an evidence of his\\nmarvelous quickness. A sudden glitter of steel--a flash--a report, and\\nthen a death-groan.\\n\\nCharles Guilford lay upon his face, the blood slowly oozing from a\\ntiny, discolored hole in the center of his forehead.\\n\\nA low cry rose round the group. A simultaneous movement--and full\\ntwo-score hands fell upon as many weapons.\\n\\nThe tall, lithe form drew more erect, with head flung back and eyes\\nthat seemed like glowing coals. _Click--click_, went the notchlike\\nsprings of his pistols.\\n\\nThe sullen roar of two-score voices ceased. The weapons, though still\\nclutched, were not drawn. And the foremost slowly shrunk back. Fear was\\nwritten upon their faces.\\n\\nAnd all this because one man seemed awakened. But that man was Yellow\\nJack.\\n\\n\"Gentlemen,\" began the outlaw chieftain, and his voice was as even and\\ngentle as when first he spoke, \"I have a few words of explanation to\\ngive you why I shot that carrion. It was because he was a traitor at\\nheart--to me, if not to you. I saved him from the hangman\\'s rope, and\\nbrought him here. He served admirably as a man; but raising him to be\\nan officer spoiled him. You elected him; I could not refuse, though\\nI knew that this day must come in time. Well, he\\'s dead. There is no\\nuse in producing proof of his treachery, unless some of you demand it.\\nThen I will comply, of course. Is any one dissatisfied? If so, let him\\nadvance and give in his plea.\"\\n\\nNo one advanced. Perhaps they deemed it scarcely prudent to do so, with\\nthat body still lying before them.\\n\\nYellow Jack smiled. He had conquered now, even as he had scores of\\ntimes before, by sheer audacity. And _now_ Lottie Mitchell was his;\\nno one could dispute his choice, unless--He scowled as he thought of\\nMabel, his wife.\\n\\n\"Good! I am glad to see you so sensible. Of course, we must have\\nanother election. To-morrow will do. Talk the matter over between\\nyourselves. The choice lies with you.\" And then Yellow Jack walked\\naway, without so much as a glance at his victim.\\n\\nMeantime, Lottie Mitchell had been aroused from her torpidity--as it\\nmight almost be called. And this by one of whom we have had only a\\nfleeting glimpse--the being called by Yellow Jack, \"Crazy Joe.\"\\n\\nHe had glided into the little cell-like apartment adjoining \"the\\ngrotto,\" where Lottie was sitting in apathetic despair. She glanced up\\nat his entrance, but recognizing him, again drooped her eyes.\\n\\n\"Lady,\" whispered Crazy Joe, after a keen glance around the chamber,\\n\"cheer up. You have a friend near who will do his best to free you. Be\\ncautious--do not cry out. If they suspect who and what I really am,\\nboth you and I are lost,\" he added hastily as Lottie gave vent to an\\nexclamation of surprise.\\n\\nThis was the first time she had heard him utter an intelligible\\nsentence. To her, as to others, he had been the harmless idiot. For\\nwhat had he been playing such a part?--for now there was no trace of\\nidiocy, only the sharp, acute decision of a bold and determined man.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t wonder at your surprise,\" he added, with a kindly smile, as\\nhe drew nearer, \"I have played my part well, and, indeed, I had need\\nto, since my life depended upon its success. But never mind that now. I\\nfear interruption before I can explain. Listen, now. I am telling you\\nthe truth, and placing my life in your hands.\\n\\n\"As you see, I am no idiot. That is my mask, put on the better to\\nenable me to gain my purpose. Instead, I am a spy--a spy of the\\nGovernment. My purpose now is to learn all the secrets of the place, so\\nthat, when the time comes for another attack, they can\\'t baffle us as\\nthey did the last time.\\n\\n\"I assumed this disguise, and wandered for days amongst these hills,\\nbefore I was picked up, almost starving, too. I was brought here, and\\nclosely questioned. I was only an idiot--so I made them believe. Only\\nan iron will carried me through, for they tried me in every manner,\\neven waking me from a sound sleep with a quick question. But I had\\nstudied my part closely, and foiled them.\\n\\n\"Now it is time for act second. I have learned all I care to know, and\\nmust disappear. They will think nothing of that--for I am an idiot,\"\\nand he laughed silently, but gleefully. \"They\\'ll think I\\'ve wandered\\naway, or been killed by wild beasts. And then--well, they\\'ll see me\\nagain, and with me will be a host of \\'boys in blue.\\'\\n\\n\"Why do I tell you this? Because you are in great peril--not of\\n_death_, but even worse than that--and will need all the courage you\\ncan muster. I would take you with me, but that would ruin all. Pursuit\\nwould be made--for _you_--and I killed. Then would your last hope die.\\n\\n\"You must wait patiently, and, if possible, gain time. I will be back\\nin two weeks, at furthest. If you can evade the peril until then, we\\nwill save you. If not--then we will remember you while dealing our\\nblows. Do you understand me?\"\\n\\n\"Partly. But what is this great peril--_he_ is dead, and Mabel is my\\nfriend. Surely, she will not let them murder me!\" And Lottie paused in\\ngenuine surprise.\\n\\n\"I will tell you, then, though \\'tis a delicate subject. But this is no\\ntime for false delicacy. Then--I allude to Yellow Jack--to his passion\\nfor you,\" hurriedly added the man.\\n\\n\"But he--Mabel is his wife!\"\\n\\n\"True--or passes for such. But that matters little to him. Why did\\nhe kill Guilford--his best and bravest man? Because that man claimed\\n_you_--whom he wanted for himself. _Now_ do you understand me?\"\\n\\n\"I--think I do,\" faltered Lottie, turning ghastly pale.\\n\\n\"Then--listen. The trial will come--sooner or later. It may come\\nto-day--or it may not come until we return. For _your_ sake I hope not.\\nBut you must be prepared for it. You must play a part. You must hide\\nyour real feelings, and dissemble. Though keen as steel, you can blind\\nhim in his passion with your mother wit. Affect to think of the matter.\\nTell him you are too heart-sick--that all around is so new and strange\\nthat you must have time to reconcile yourself to the change. Tell him\\nany thing--only gain time. Gain two weeks, and I pledge my word--my\\nlife, that you shall be saved. I give you the word of a man who never\\nlied unless to an enemy, such as those with whom I am now dealing. Only\\ntwo weeks, at the most. I may return before, but if I am not here then,\\nyou can know that I am dead.\"\\n\\n\"You frighten me, but--\"\\n\\n\"Hist! there is some one coming! Be cautious--hide your feelings, or\\nall is lost!\" whispered the man, again becoming \"Crazy Joe,\" as he\\ncrouched down upon the floor and began tracing meaningless figures in\\nthe dry sand with his fingers, crooning a low, monotonous strain as\\nunmeaning as his blank and expressionless features.\\n\\nYellow Jack entered. He gave a start as the dark figure seated upon the\\nfloor caught his eyes, but then, with recognition, came reassurance. He\\ncared little whether the idiot heard his words or not.\\n\\n\"Come, dear lady, this will never do,\" the outlaw chief uttered in a\\nsoft, musical tone, as he sunk upon the little pallet beside which\\nLottie sat. \"You are fading your beauty and dimming your eyes by this\\nunceasing grief. The past is past--let it sink into oblivion. Live for\\nthe present, for the future--life can be gay and pleasant, if you only\\nwill it should. All around will be your servants--and I, the chief\\nof this band of brave men--will be the humblest one of all at your\\ncommand. You make no answer,\" he added, his keen eyes seeking to read\\nthe inner thoughts of the maiden. \"You are not offended at my plain\\nwords?\"\\n\\n\"No--not offended,\" hesitated Lottie, at a warning glance from the\\nseeming idiot.\\n\\n\"Thanks. Now I will give you a few words to think over for a time.\\nAnd think over them carefully you must, for a great deal depends upon\\nyour answer. You, among others, are deeply concerned. In fact, upon\\nyour decision rests the whole of your future. Thus much, by way of\\nintroduction.\\n\\n\"You may not know that by the rules of the band, Charley Guilford\\nreally became your master, by his capturing you himself. Well--though\\nhe was a good enough man, in the way of duty, he was a devil at heart.\\nHe would have killed you with his cruelty in a month. For that reason\\nI took you from him; for that reason, and because your face awoke a\\nmemory in my heart that I thought forever dead. Your face then, pale\\nand care-worn, reminded me of my mother, as I last saw her, just before\\nshe died. I know now that she killed herself, because--but never mind.\\nI did not come here to speak of the past.\\n\\n\"Well, Guilford objected to my course, and--I shot him to-day. He\\nwould have served me so to-morrow, but I was ahead of him.\\n\\n\"Now what I mean is this. You cannot lead this life always. You would\\ndie, shut up so close. And were you to walk about the village, you\\nwould always be in danger, from what, you can guess. For this reason,\\nmore than any thing else, I am here now, to tell you that you must\\nchoose between me and one of the men. In other words, you must become\\nmy wife.\"\\n\\n\"You--but Mabel is your wife!\"\\n\\n\"Well--she passes for such, and so did the one before her. Never\\ntrouble about that--you must decide upon what I have told you. I must\\ngo now. You can give your answer to-morrow.\"\\n\\nYellow Jack left the room, and, after a warning glance and whisper, the\\nspy did the same.\\n\\nThat night Crazy Joe disappeared. As he had predicted, this caused\\nlittle or no comment. It was only an idiot gone.\\n\\nOn the morrow Yellow Jack again visited Lottie. It is useless to repeat\\nhis arguments. They were the same in substance as those just recorded,\\nsave that they were more vehement and full of passion.\\n\\nLottie, frightened and heart-sick, still did not forget the warning of\\nCrazy Joe--or Joe Burleson, as he had told her his real name was--and\\nbegged for time. This he granted, though with evident reluctance.\\n\\nScarcely had he disappeared than Mabel rushed into the room with\\na maniacal fury, clutching a long, keen-pointed stiletto. With a\\nhalf-stifled scream, she strove to plunge it into Lottie\\'s breast. The\\nperil lent the captive strength, and after a desperate struggle, she\\nsucceeded in disarming the madwoman.\\n\\nThen, in hysterical sobbings the truth came out, and Lottie learned\\nwhat had caused the sudden change in one who had, until that hour,\\ntreated her so kindly. She had overheard all that passed between Lottie\\nand Yellow Jack in the second interview.\\n\\nFortunate it was that Lottie remembered Burleson\\'s caution never to\\nspeak without weighing every word that she said, while in her dangerous\\nposition. Only for that she would have told Mabel all: have told her\\nhow she loathed the very sight of the monster, Yellow Jack, and that\\nshe was only playing her cards to gain time that she might be saved.\\n\\nInstead, she only disclaimed all thought of winning Yellow Jack from\\nher; that she would far rather matters remained as they were.\\n\\nMabel, on the other hand, saw only one hope left her, and that was in\\nthe escape of Lottie. While she remained, the outlaw would only stray\\nthe further from his rightful allegiance, and with that hope, she\\ndeclared to Lottie that she would assist her to escape.\\n\\nRendered suspicious by this sudden change, Lottie was reserved, though\\nthe very thought caused her heart to leap for joy. Thus she calmly\\nlistened, without saying yea or nay.\\n\\nAt length Mabel turned and left the chamber. In the passage just\\nwithout, a dark figure met her and clutched her wrist with a grasp of\\nsteel. It was Yellow Jack, and in that moment she knew that he had\\noverheard all, and that her doom was sealed. For a moment she trembled;\\nthen her true Spanish courage came to her rescue, and she followed his\\nlead without a word.\\n\\nEntering their own chamber, Yellow Jack, with a terrible courtesy, led\\nMabel to a softly-cushioned chair, and waited until she was seated.\\nThen he drew another chair forward, and seated himself before her. Pale\\nand calm, she met his steady gaze with one as unflinching.\\n\\n\"Du you know what is in my mind now, Mabel?\" he at length uttered.\\n\\n\"Yes--if, as I suppose, you were listening to what I said to--to _her_\\nin there.\"\\n\\n\"I did hear--that you intended to prove traitor to me.\"\\n\\n\"Not to you--to the man who was about putting his wife from him in\\nfavor of a stranger.\"\\n\\n\"Well--we will not quarrel about trifles. You have known me long enough\\nto guess what such attempts cost. Now I ask you a plain question: would\\nyou rather leave me and return to your people, or die here beside me?\"\\n\\n\"This is the only choice left me?\" Mabel asked, and for the first time\\nher voice trembled.\\n\\n\"Is it not enough?\" coldly came the reply.\\n\\n\"Since _you_ say so, yes. For ten years I have been with you, through\\nall, day and night. I will not leave you now, of my own will, because I\\nlove you. I will die here, but not by _your_ hand!\"\\n\\n\"I am glad that you object to that, because I hate such trouble. Well,\\nto business. First, write a line saying that this is your own deed. The\\nmen reverence you so that they might make trouble were they to think I\\nhad killed you.\"\\n\\nWithout a word, Mabel did as directed. Then again turned toward the\\nice-hearted monster. He knew not what mercy meant, else he would have\\nrelented at that look of ineffable love.\\n\\n\"Well--you are waiting for--?\"\\n\\nMabel moved round and knelt beside him. He frowned, thinking she meant\\nto plead for her life. Instead, she wound her arms around him, and\\npressed her lips to his, in a long, lingering, farewell kiss.\\n\\nThen she rose erect. The bright poniard flashed in the lamp-light. It\\nsunk to the hilt in her warm bosom.\\n\\nSlowly she sunk to her knees, her eyes riveted upon his, and with that\\nlook of love, died!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XI.\\n\\n                        THROUGH GLOOM TO LIGHT.\\n\\n\\nThe discovery made by Burr Wythe was a heart-crushing one coming just\\nas it did, when they believed that freedom was now within their grasp.\\nAnd for a time the two friends sunk helpless beneath the blow.\\n\\nBut the reaction came soon. It was foreign to their natures to submit\\nwithout a struggle, at any time much less now, when to yield meant\\n_death_--death the most horrible; by starvation.\\n\\nThey carefully worked with their fingers around the edge of what had\\nonce been the entrance. Only hard rock was there; not a particle of\\nearth to give them renewed hope of cutting their way to the outer world\\nby persistent use of their strong-bladed knives.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis of no use, Duplin,\" at length muttered Wythe, brushing the great\\ndrops from his brow. \"We are blocked in--we must die here like dogs!\"\\n\\n\"It seems so. All around the mouth seems solid rock. But who can have\\nblocked it up? Not that one we fired at? Surely what one man could\\nplace there, two could roll away.\"\\n\\n\"It must be the big rock that stood just above the hole. It could be\\nrolled over, I think. If so, fifty men couldn\\'t raise it now.\"\\n\\n\"Well, one thing is settled. Whoever closed this entrance wished for\\nour death. Thus it\\'s not likely we have any thing to hope from them. So\\nwe must depend upon ourselves, if we hope to ever see daylight again,\"\\nthoughtfully added Duplin.\\n\\n\"Yes--but what can we do? We have no light, no food, no drink. We might\\nas well sit down here and die, at once, as to wander blindly on through\\nthese winding passages that seem to end nowhere.\"\\n\\n\"Come--this is pure folly, Burr. Though I admit that the case looks\\nhard, very hard, I will not knock under so easy. We may as well _try_\\nfor life, even though we fail, as to sit here idly bemoaning our fate.\\nTime will pass easier and quicker while we are busy. I am going to\\nfight for it as long as I can. Then--when I can stand it no longer--the\\nthirst and hunger, I mean--why, I have a revolver, well loaded, here.\\nYou understand?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and I am with you, Duplin. I was a fool. We will make another\\nattempt. It can be no worse than now, and may be better,\" energetically\\ncried Wythe, springing to his feet, and then the hands of the comrades\\nmet in a hearty clasp.\\n\\nThey turned and blindly reëntered the tunnel. It was slow, weary work,\\nbut they persisted, and for hours crept on, for the greater part of\\nthe time upon hands and knees now and then cheering each other with an\\nencouraging word of hope.\\n\\nEven was there time, it would be wearisome to follow them step by step\\nthrough all these winding passages, more than once retracing their\\nsteps to begin anew, as they came to the abrupt termination of some\\ntunnel. Enough has already been said, to give the reader an idea of\\ntheir experience, in a preceding chapter.\\n\\nEnough to say that kind Providence guided them aright, after almost\\nincredible sufferings, and finally a dim light, far in the distance,\\nbroke upon their strained vision.\\n\\nFor a moment they paused, fearing to move, to breathe, lest the glad\\nvision should vanish. And in that moment they read the truth.\\n\\nWith inarticulate cries they arose and rushed forward. It was no\\ndelusion--the light was that of heaven; and then they stood in the open\\nair, beneath the welcome sun!\\n\\nThey sunk upon the ground, faint and speechless. They were not what\\nis called _Christians_, and they did not raise their voices in loud\\nthanksgiving for the great mercy that had been shown them. And yet they\\nwere grateful--they recognized the goodness of the Omnipotent in their\\nrescue, and their thanksgiving, if mute, was no less sincere and devout\\nthan if it had been couched in the most eloquent of terms.\\n\\nTheir hands met and were lightly clasped. For a time they seemed\\ndrinking in the fresh, balmy air, the clear, glorious sunlight, with\\na rapture that until now had been a stranger to their hearts. All\\nthis was what they had mentally bidden farewell to, as they believed,\\nforever.\\n\\n\"We are free at last, Burr!\" murmured Duplin.\\n\\n\"Yes--but I\\'m awful thirsty!\" was the prosaic reply.\\n\\nThat word recalled them to a sense of their sufferings. As they now\\nknew, by the position occupied by the sun, they had been beneath the\\nsurface for over a day and night; and during all these hours they had\\nate no food, tasted no water whatever.\\n\\nDuplin gazed keenly around. Then he gave a low, husky cry. He\\nrecognized the spot where they were. In their wanderings they had\\npassed entirely through the great hill!\\n\\n\"Yonder is the creek--now for water!\" he cried, and then sprung forward\\nlike a startled deer.\\n\\nFlat upon their stomachs they lay, and quaffed the cool, sparkling\\nwater with ecstatic delight. It was almost worth enduring such a trial\\nfor the pleasure imbibed with that draught.\\n\\n\"Ha!\" suddenly exclaimed Wythe, as he started up. \"Look at this,\\nDuplin,\" and he pointed to a damp, blood-stained rag that lay half upon\\na rock, half in the water.\\n\\nThe same thought struck them both. They had passed through the\\nlabyrinth--might not Jack and his captor or captors have done the same?\\n\\n\"It\\'s so,\" muttered Duplin, pointing to a broad track close beside\\ntheir own. \"There is the same track that Jack measured. Hurrah! we may\\nfind him yet!\"\\n\\n\"True--but how? Alive, or--_dead_?\"\\n\\nIn silence the two friends scrutinized the sandy ground around. Finally\\nthey were rewarded by finding where the trail led away from the further\\nside of the creek.\\n\\nIn silence they glanced at each other, as they noted the point toward\\nwhich the trail now tended. It seemingly led direct to the valley\\nwhence they had made that strange discovery--to the cliff in which\\nlived the strange couple.\\n\\nThen the truth struck them, and they wondered that they had not\\nthought of this solution before. The madman was their strangely-acting\\nadversary. And in this fact they saw a solution of his wild antics with\\nthe glowing skeletons. Surely no sane man would have acted as he had\\ndone--have braved such danger.\\n\\n\"Dead or alive, we will find Jack there,\" at length uttered Duplin.\\n\\n\"Find him we must, but it requires caution. One man like that could\\nkeep a thousand at bay from the cave. And if he is mad, it would be a\\ncrime to kill him, even in self-defense.\"\\n\\n\"Come. We will do the best we can.\"\\n\\nThough feeling morally certain as to where the trail would lead them,\\nthe gold-hunters did not neglect any precaution, and slowly traced out\\nthe footprints. True to their suspicions, they led directly to the foot\\nof the cliff, where they were lost upon the flinty rocks.\\n\\nConcealing themselves, they patiently watched the cliff for hours, in\\nvain hoping to learn whether the madman was still in the cave. But\\nthen, urged on by anxiety for their comrade, they cautiously began\\nscaling the cliff.\\n\\nWhen half-way to the ledge that served as entrance to the cave, Duplin,\\nwho was in advance, abruptly paused. A slight noise from above caught\\nhis ear.\\n\\nFor a brief instant a face met his startled gaze, then it vanished.\\nBut, brief though the glance was, he recognized it as the face of the\\nmaiden he had seen once before.\\n\\n\"They\\'ve discovered us, Burr,\" he muttered. \"Now for it! Up, or we are\\nlost!\"\\n\\nBut, contrary to their expectations, they reached the cliff-ledge\\nunmolested, and then sprung forward to the cave entrance. They paused;\\nall was still. Only for that brief vision, they would have believed it\\nwas unoccupied.\\n\\nAll within was dark, impenetrable to their gaze, dazzled by the bright\\nsunlight. But then there came a cry--a voice well known to their ears.\\n\\nThe voice of Jack Tyrrel, for whom they had dared and endured so much!\\n\\n\"Boys--thank God! you are here!\"\\n\\nThese were the words. Then Duplin and Wythe sprung forward. It was a\\nhappy meeting, and for a time none noticed the maiden, who had shrunk\\nback against the wall. But then Jack glanced around and said:\\n\\n\"Lucy, come here; these are my friends. And, boys, if you are glad to\\nsee me, thank her. She saved my life.\"\\n\\nThis introduction put all upon the best of terms, and for a time that\\nwas a joyous group. But then Lucy\\'s thoughts reverted to her father.\\nWhere was he? Why had he not returned? Never before had he remained so\\nlong absent.\\n\\nJack, with eyes wonderfully sharpened by the last few hours, read\\naright her thoughts, and closely questioned his comrades, who were\\nnow eating the food set before them by Lucy, in immense haste, as\\nto whether they had seen the madman--or, as he said, Mr. Bradford.\\nWarned by their suspicions, they said little of what had occurred, but\\nvolunteered to go in quest of him.\\n\\n\"Thank you, boys. I\\'d go, but this confounded hurt won\\'t let me. Take a\\nlook at the camp, while out. He may be there.\"\\n\\nTheir hunger appeased, the two men descended the cliff, and set off\\nat a rapid rate toward their camp. After an hour\\'s hard walking they\\nreached the crest of the hill from which they had first gazed down upon\\nthe valley that contained the bed of gold nuggets.\\n\\nBoth paused, with a simultaneous cry. Human forms met their gaze. Their\\ncamp was occupied!\\n\\nOver a mile distant, they could not recognize sex or color. Of course,\\nnone but _men_ were there, but were they white or red--enemies or\\nfriends? Scarcely the latter, though.\\n\\nThe two friends exchanged glances. A hard, determined expression rested\\nupon each face, and their eyes told their resolve.\\n\\nA fortune, hard-earned, lay there, belonging to them. Should they\\nabandon it now, after all that they had endured? No!\\n\\nNeither spoke a word, but looked to their pistols, renewed each cap,\\nafter seeing that the nipples were well primed. A miss-fire might be\\nfatal, now.\\n\\nThen they glided forward, not seeking to hide their movements. That,\\nafter the valley was reached, would be impossible. Nearly a mile of\\nlevel sand, without a rock or shrub, must be passed over.\\n\\nAnd yet they reached the water-course unmolested, unchallenged, unless\\nthe one feeble shout that came to their ears was such. They stood\\namazed. A terrible spectacle lay before their eyes.\\n\\nFour men lay stretched upon the ground, only one of whom gave signs of\\nlife. He had dragged himself to the brush camp, and was now lying in\\nits shelter.\\n\\nThe others were dead. Two of them lay upon their faces, the flint-head\\nof an arrow protruding from each back. The other, close by, still\\nclutched a bow; in the other hand was an arrow, that could not be\\nfitted to the string before death overtook him.\\n\\n\"It is the madman--Bradford!\" muttered Duplin.\\n\\n\"And that man is Paul Chicot!\" added Wythe.\\n\\n\"Help, friends--for the love of God! help!\" gasped the wounded man--the\\nsole survivor of this tragedy.\\n\\nIt was hours before Chicot could explain this scene. First he told\\nall--how Upshur had tempted him and Dooley, and of all that had\\noccurred since then. Of how the madman had warned them away, when\\nUpshur incautiously shot him. Even as he fell, Bradford had his\\nrevenge. Like lightning-bolts three arrows sped, and two men died.\\nThe third, with sure aim but failing power, pierced Chicot\\'s breast,\\ninflicting a severe but not necessarily fatal wound, now that he could\\nhave care. The robbers had searched in vain for the buried store of\\ngold, and Wythe found it intact.\\n\\nAnd then, while Wythe nursed Chicot, Duplin hastened to carry the\\nmournful tidings to Lucy. For a time she sunk beneath the shock, but\\nthen revived. It had in a measure been expected. She had known that his\\nlife could end only in that way.\\n\\nThus it chanced that a week later we find her cooking for the\\nbusily-laboring gold hunters, and nursing Paul Chicot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XII.\\n\\n                           EXIT YELLOW JACK.\\n\\n\\nLate one night Duplin came into camp in a state of considerable\\nexcitement. It being his day to act as forager, he had remained so long\\nabsent that his companions were very uneasy lest harm had befallen him.\\nGreat was their agitation when he made known his discovery.\\n\\nWandering further to the south than customary, he had just before dusk,\\ncome upon a large encampment; after a brief scouting he recognized the\\nbody as being United States soldiers. He did not venture nearer them,\\nbut at once hastened back to lay the matter before his friends.\\n\\nHere was a safe escort at hand, by accepting which they might be spared\\nall the toil and danger they otherwise might expect to meet on their\\nreturn journey to the States. But, on the other hand, there was their\\ngold. It could not be concealed, so that the eyes of the soldiers would\\nnot recognize it. Among so many, there might be some evil-hearted men,\\nonly too glad to win independence by an act of treachery.\\n\\nThe matter was thoroughly discussed, and then decided. They would trust\\nto their former plan. At this Paul Chicot gave a sigh of relief. He was\\nyet too ill to be moved with safety.\\n\\nThis body of cavalry, as the reader guesses, was indeed that to which\\nJoe Burleson had alluded in his conversation with Lottie Mitchell.\\nHe had succeeded in reaching it, and was now on his way back to the\\nretreat of Yellow Jack and his outlaws.\\n\\nThough Duplin did not know it, they had been resting their animals for\\nseveral hours, preparing for a hard and forced march. That night the\\nblow was to be dealt, and under cover of the darkness they hoped to\\ngain the Retreat before being discovered, guided as they were by one so\\nthoroughly familiar with the surroundings as was Burleson.\\n\\nJoe had confided all to the officer leading the troops, and had gained\\nhis consent to a daring move. He had not forgotten his promise to\\nLottie; he would save her if possible. But would he be in time? The\\nbold spy shuddered as this fear assailed his heart. Though knowing her\\nfor so brief a time, he had given his entire heart to the pale-faced\\nmaiden. And the love of such a man, rude and unlettered though he was,\\nwas not to be despised.\\n\\nWith this view, Joe glided on in advance, while the soldiers dismounted\\nand stood their horses at a safe distance, then removed all articles\\nthat, by jingling, could possibly alarm the foe too soon.\\n\\nDressed as he had been when first appearing at the village, Burleson\\nentered without fear, knowing that Crazy Joe was a privileged person.\\nBut the village was quiet. The outlaws seemed all asleep.\\n\\nNot all--from the hillside, shining through the tiny windows that he\\nknew looked out from the grotto, Joe caught the faint ray of a light.\\nAnd more!\\n\\nA half-stifled scream came from that direction. His teeth grated\\ntogether, his eyes flashed with a deadly glow as he glided into the\\nlittle hut that sheltered the entrance.\\n\\nHe recognized the voice of Lottie Mitchell!\\n\\nHe paused at the entrance of the grotto. All was still. But a sight met\\nhis eyes that fairly maddened him.\\n\\nNear the center of the room a man was bending over the form of a woman;\\nthe latter seemed insensible.\\n\\nThe man was Yellow Jack. The woman was Lottie Mitchell.\\n\\nThank God! he was yet in time! Such was the thought that flashed across\\nhis mind like intuition. Why, he could not have explained himself.\\n\\nHe did not speak--made no sound. But he bounded forward like a panther\\nthat thirsted for blood.\\n\\nOne hand clutched the neck of Yellow Jack. The other, uplifted,\\nclutched a long-bladed knife.\\n\\nThe weapon descended with a dull, thrilling _thud_. The steel guard\\ndented deep into the outlaw\\'s back. The blood-stained point protruded\\nthrough the gayly embroidered shirt-front.\\n\\nWithout a groan, Yellow Jack sunk forward upon the insensible form of\\nhis intended victim, a dead man. The blade had cloven his heart in\\ntwain.\\n\\nTenderly Burleson lifted the maiden from the floor and bore her to\\nthe soft couch of skins beyond. Her eyes opened, and a murmur of\\nthanksgiving told that she recognized him as a true friend.\\n\\nIn hurried words he told her all, and cautioned her to remain silent.\\nThen, with a lingering glance at her, he turned and glided away to give\\nthe signal of death.\\n\\nSilently, like the shadows of death, the soldiers glided up and gained\\nfoothold in the outlaws\\' village. And then--but why give details?\\nSurely enough bloodshed has already stained these pages.\\n\\nThat the surprise was complete--that, as the roaring flames of their\\nblazing huts roused the slumbering outlaws, the wild yell of assault\\nwas given, is enough.\\n\\nThe struggle, though brief, was desperate and bloody. The outlaws never\\nthought of begging mercy. They knew that it would be denied them, and\\nso, fighting, they died. An hour--then the band was annihilated.\\n\\nThe next day a strange cavalcade left the Retreat. Horses and cattle\\nwere heavily loaded down with plunder. In a comfortable litter rode\\nLottie Mitchell. Beside her was Joe Burleson. Poor fellow, he was happy\\nthen. But his awakening came soon enough, though his love deserved\\nbetter reward.\\n\\nIn safety they reached Fort Laramie. And then Lottie was taken ill, and\\nonly awoke to life again when winter had snow-bound all within the fort.\\n\\nAnd, oh! the joy that awaited her then! The form that first met her\\nconscious gaze, worn and pale with long and constant watching, was that\\nof Burr Wythe!\\n\\nThis fact is easily explained.\\n\\nThe \"pocket\" of gold eventually gave out, or afforded so little reward\\nthat it was not deemed worth while wintering there. So Paul Chicot--now\\nfully recovered--and Duplin contrived to capture a sufficient number of\\nhorses and mules from those that had escaped to the hills during the\\nattack on the outlaws\\' retreat, to mount the party and convey their\\nprecious gold. Chicot guided them aright to Fort Laramie, though the\\nmost of their gold wad securely _cached_ among the hills where it would\\nbe safe. Then they entered the fort. There they first heard the fate\\nof the train they had abandoned, and found Lottie Mitchell, the sole\\nsurvivor, besides themselves.\\n\\nBurr was prepared to meet Lottie\\'s words concerning the murder of\\npoor Hefler. Upshur had confessed to the deed, and Chicot could bear\\nwitness to it. And then, though there was little need of the words, he\\nconfessed his love. And Lottie?\\n\\nWell, she gained in health and spirits so amazingly, that long before\\nthe snow began to disappear before the warm breath of spring, there was\\na double wedding at the old fort, that occasioned more pure, heartfelt\\njoy, as well as boisterous fun and jollity, than ever before marked its\\nannals.\\n\\nAnd then, when the green grass began to appear, a small cavalcade took\\nits departure from Laramie, heading toward the rising sun. At nightfall\\nDuplin and Chicot rode back and opened their _cache_, bringing with\\nthem its precious contents.\\n\\nNever was a more delightful trip than that, but our space forbids a\\ndetailed description. They reached \"the States\" in safety. Paul Chicot\\nsettled at St. Joseph, Mo., and entered into the fur trade. He still\\nlives.\\n\\nDuplin returned to the loyal maiden who had so long waited for him.\\nThey, too, were happy.\\n\\nAnd thus we leave them.\\n\\n\\n                               THE END.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n[Transcriber\\'s Note: The is no CHAPTER X. heading in original text]\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                          DIME POCKET NOVELS.\\n\\n              PUBLISHED SEMI-MONTHLY, AT TEN CENTS EACH.\\n\\n\\n     1--Hawkeye Harry.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\n\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation\\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s website\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n'"
